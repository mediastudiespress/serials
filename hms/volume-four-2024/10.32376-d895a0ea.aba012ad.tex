\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

What are the causes for the phenomenon of populism in Western liberal
democracies in the early twenty-first century? As a result of Donald
Trump\textquotesingle s election victory in 2016 and the electoral
successes of populist movements in Europe, populism studies has emerged
as noticeable subfield in communication science. We sketch a survey of
this subfield with an analysis of 114 articles published between 2000
and 2022 from six journals. The field of populism studies is governed by
the ``illusio'' that digitalization, mediatization, or populist
communication style favors the rise of right-wing populism. This
analysis shows that these factors are unlikely to have contributed to
its rise. The stances taken by researchers to explain populism vary
depending on whether the university is located in the European Union or
the Anglophone world. Critical studies of the impact of neoliberalism as
a cause of populism are rarely included in the research.

¿Cuáles son las causas del auge del populismo en las democracias liberales occidentales en el comienzo del siglo XXI? El área de los estudios de populismo se ha consolidado como un subcampo relevante en el campo de la comunicación como resultado de la victoria electoral de Donald Trump en 2016 y de los éxitos electorales de movimientos populistas en Europa. Proponemos un estudio de este subcampo de los estudios de populismo mediante el análisis de 114 artículos publicados entre los años 2000 y 2022 en 6 revistas científicas. El campo de los estudios de populismo está dominado por la \emph{illusio} de que la digitalización, la mediatización y el estilo de comunicación populista favorecen el auge de los populismos de derecha. Sin embargo, nuestro análisis muestra que es poco probable que estos factores hayan contribuido a su ascenso. Las posturas que los investigadores toman para explicar el populismo varían dependiendo de si la universidad está ubicada en la Unión Europea o en el mundo anglófono. Los estudios críticos sobre el impacto del neoliberalismo como causa del populismo raramente se incluyen en las investigaciones.

\newthought{In the early} twenty-first century, populism is on the rise in Western
liberal democracies. Populism itself arrives on the back of the
neoliberalism and digitalization of the late twentieth century. These
two meta-processes may be at the root of populism. Communication
scholars often attribute populism to the spread of digital
media.\footnote{Gianpetro Mazzoleni, ``Populism and the Media,'' in
  \emph{Twenty-First Century Populism}: \emph{The Spectre of Western
  European Democracy},'' ed. Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell
  (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008); Sven Engesser, Nicole Ernst, Frank
  Esser, and Florin Büchl, ``Populism and Social Media: How Politicians
  Spread a Fragmented Ideology,'' \emph{Information, Communication \&
  Society} 20, 8 (2017).} In sociology and political science, on the
other hand, researchers highlight changes in social structures as causes
of populism\footnote{Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris, ``Trump, Brexit,
  and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash,''
  paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political
  Science Association, Philadelphia, PA, September 2017.}---combined
with critique of neoliberalism.\footnote{James Gwartney, Robert Lawson,
  and Joshua Hall, ``Economic Freedom of the World 2017 Annual Report,''
  Fraser Institute, 2017.} We contribute to this conversation by
analyzing 114 articles from six journals in communication studies. The
articles, which were published between 2000 and 2022, contain the word
``populism'' or ``populist'' in the title, abstract, or as a keyword.
Taking the epistemological standpoint that scientific facts are also
socially constructed,\footnote{Bruno Latour and Steven Woolgar,
  \emph{Laboratory Life}: \emph{The Social Construction of Scientific
  Facts} (Beverly Hills, CA: Sage, 1979).} we objectify the results by
means of a field analysis inspired by Bourdieu.\footnote{Pierre
  Bourdieu, \emph{The Rules of the Art: Genesis and Structure of the
  Literary Field} (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996).}

Communication studies is a fragmented post-discipline without a
theoretical core or sub-disciplines conducting independent research.
Topical interconnections such as the term populism bring sub-disciplines
together in a communication imagination.\footnote{Silvio Waisbord,
  \emph{Communication: A Post-discipline} (Cambridge, UK: Polity Press,
  2019).} Populism as a shared dimension particularly interconnects the
sub-disciplines of ``political communication,'' ``journalism,''
``cross-cultural/cross-national communication,'' and
``critical/discourse analysis.''\footnote{Hyunjin Song, Jakob-Moritz
  Eberl, and Olga Eisele, ``Less Fragmented Than We Thought? Toward
  Clarification of a Subdisciplinary Linkage in Communication Science,
  2010--2019,'' \emph{Journal of Communication} 70, no. 3 (2020).}
Accordingly, we selected the journals for this study based on their
thematic focus in addition to the five-year impact factor (IF) indicated
on their website at the start of the study in April 2022. This field
analysis includes six journals tied to the field of communication: The
\emph{Journal of Communication} is the putative flagship journal in the
field with the highest symbolic capital (five-year IF in April 2022:
9.5); the \emph{International Journal of Press/Politics} (5.4) provides
us with a communication journal that has meaningful connections to
political science; \emph{Journalism Studies} (3.8) allows us to
integrate the perspective of journalism studies; \emph{Media, Culture \&
Society} (3.1) gives us a journal with an explicit critical/cultural
view; the inclusion of \emph{New Media \& Society} (7.7) gives us a
chance to incorporate a journal that is largely focused on
digitalization; and \emph{Communication Theory} (5.5) programs
theoretical and meta-perspectives into our study. By design, these
journals' relatively high impact factors lend to this study a focus on
the power pole in the field of communication studies. Since journal
articles are the product of a collective process and knowledge is
hierarchically ordered, we capture what has been deemed to be the most
thoroughly consecrated academic knowledge of our time on the topic of
media and populism. Major journals exert symbolic power within their
academic field and through the consecration effect into other
fields.\footnote{Pierre Bourdieu, \emph{Homo Academicus} (Stanford:
  Stanford University Press, 1988).} Their assumptions and results, if
not critically reflected, can\pagebreak

\noindent be transformed into doxa, a set of beliefs
and values accepted as true and unquestionable within a given
society.\footnote{Pierre Bourdieu and Loïc J. D. Wacquant, \emph{An
  Invitation to Reflexive Sociology} (Chicago: University of Chicago
  Press, 1992).}

By situating these studies in a social field, we can present conceptions
of populism, causal contexts for populism, and research findings in an
objectified space, weight them according to their distribution of
capital, and identify focal points and gaps. Our analysis shows that
theoretical perspectives on populism, choices of methods, and
interpretations of results are partly shaped by institutional
characteristics; and patterns in the dynamics of the field enable us to
forecast where populism research is headed, what we can steer against,
which perspectives are most promising based on consideration of the
empirical results, and/or which need more institutional
support.\footnote{Bourdieu and Wacquant, \emph{Reflexive Sociology.}}

The article is structured as follows. A field analysis implies three
interrelated, necessary moments. First, we outline the genesis of the
field of populism studies and its position in the social space and
identify the field's doxa and illusio. While doxa describes a set of
common, shared beliefs within a field, ``illusio,'' in
Bourdieu\textquotesingle s terminology, is the specific belief of actors
or groups of actors about why it is worthwhile to invest their resources
in the field and how they do so.\footnote{Bourdieu and Wacquant,
  \emph{Reflexive Sociology;} Alexis von Mirbach, \emph{DigitaleIllusio:
  Online-Journalisten in Argentinien, China, Deutschland und den USA}
  (Berlin: LitVerlag, 2014).} In the second section we consider the
range of positions taken by populism scholars regarding the main driver
of populism, which is alternately identified as neoliberalism, social
structures, mediatization, or digitalization. We establish relations
between the studies of the field based on whether they represent
orthodox, heterodox, or heretical actor groups and summarize the
empirical evidence for each potential driver of populism. In a third
step, we elaborate the habitus of the groups of actors based on their
theoretical, regional, methodological, institutional, and temporal
characteristics. Since the concept of habitus is complex and has largely
been studied for the power pole of communication studies,\footnote{Michael
  Meyen, ``International Communication Association Fellows,''
  \emph{International Journal of Communication} 6 (2012).} it is
noteworthy that our focus is on the second step, the field analysis. In
the conclusion, we link our field analysis to Bourdieu\textquotesingle s
argument to explain the rise of populist movements. In his works such as
``The Weight of the World''\footnote{Pierre Bourdieu et al., \emph{The
  Weight of the World: Social Suffering in Contemporary Society}, trans.
  Priscila P. Ferguson, Susan Emanuel, Joe Johnson, and Shoggy T. Waryn
  (Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 1999).} or ``Firing Back,''\footnote{Pierre
  Bourdieu, \emph{Firing Back: Against the Tyranny of the Market II}
  (New York: The New Press, 2003).} he prognosticated today's successors
of early European populists Le Pen, Berlusconi, Haider, and others, and
rightly predicted that their rise would result from ongoing neoliberal
policies. Drawing on Thomas Piketty\textquotesingle s ``Capital and
Ideology,''\footnote{Thomas Piketty, \emph{Capital and Ideology}
  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2020).} we will update
Bourdieu\textquotesingle s arguments from more than twenty years ago and
outline a research path for investigating the relationship between
neoliberalism, the media, and populism.

\section{The Field of Populism in the Social Space and Its
Genesis}\label{the-field-of-populism-in-the-social-space-and-its-genesis}}

Bourdieu, who gained his first academic recognition in the 1960s with a
structuralist study of the Algerian Kabyle, was the
world\textquotesingle s most cited social scientist at the time of his
death in 2002. Bourdieu's thinking tools like \emph{field, habitus,} and
\emph{capital}, and his oeuvre generally (most prominently the book
\emph{Distinctions}\footnote{Pierre Bourdieu, \emph{Distinction}
  (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1984).}), are sociological
classics and remain influential in the most diverse fields of
academia.\footnote{Gisèle Sapiro, \emph{Dictionnaire International
  Bourdieu} (Paris: CNRS Éditions, 2020).} However, Bourdieu's impact in
communication studies has been uneven. Though he is regularly cited in
the subdisciplines of journalism studies\footnote{Phoebe Maares and
  Folker Hanusch, ``Interpretations of the Journalistic Field: A
  Systematic Analysis of How Journalism Scholarship Appropriates
  Bourdieusian Thought,'' \emph{Journalism}~23, no. 4 (2022).} or in the
history of communication studies,\footnote{David W. Park, ``Pierre
  Bourdieu und die Geschichte des Feldes der Kommunikationswissenschaft:
  Auf dem Weg zu einem reflexiven und konfliktorientierten Verständnis
  der Fachentwicklung,'' in~\emph{Pierre Bourdieu und die
  Kommunikationswissenschaft: Internationale Perspektiven,} ed. Thomas
  Wiedemann and Michael Meyen (Cologne: Halem, 2013).} he is largely
absent in the subdiscipline of political communication, which is also
the case for the study of populism.\footnote{Benjamin Krämer, ``How
  German Communication Research Discovered Bourdieu but Missed His
  Potential for the Study of (Populist) Political Communication,''
  \emph{History of Media Studies} 3 (2023).}

Bourdieu\textquotesingle s field theory posits that the structures of a
microcosm are homologous to the structures of the macrocosm---similar to
Russian matryoshka dolls. Accordingly, we will work our way from top to
bottom when structuring the field of populism studies. In \emph{Homo
Academicus}, Bourdieu describes the position of universities in the
social space as essentially founded on cultural capital, which places
them, like the sphere of cultural production, at the non-dominant pole.
Universities occupy a powerful position within the sphere of cultural
production because they represent an institutionalized form of cultural
capital. Within the university field, two competing principles of
legitimacy collide. On the one hand, there is a genuinely ``worldly'' or
political principle, which is held by the ``sciences of power,'' which
have the most influence on society. On the other hand, a principle
founded on the autonomy of the scientific and intellectual establishment
prevails. The social sciences occupy an intermediate position in the
university field and have staked a claim to a monopoly on legitimate
reflection and legitimate discourse on the social world.\footnote{Bourdieu,
  \emph{Homo Academicus.}} Communication studies, a comparatively recent
field, is historically closer to the heteronomous-worldly pole than to
the autonomous-intellectual pole.\footnote{Park, ``Pierre Bourdieu und
  die Geschichte des Feldes der Kommunikationswissenschaft''; Waisbord,
  \emph{Communication: A Post-discipline}.} The quantitative
socio-scientific paradigm has spread beyond the US, displacing critical
schools such as the Frankfurt School in Central Europe\footnote{Maria
  Löblich and Andreas M. Scheu, ``Writing the History of Communication
  Studies,'' \emph{Communication Theory} 21, no. 1 (2011).} and
encountering resistance in Latin America.\footnote{Jesús Martín-Barbero,
  ``A Latin American Perspective on Communication/Cultural Mediation,''
  \emph{Global Media and Communication} 2, no. 3 (2006).} The symbolic
capital of communication studies in the broader academic field is
historically low. Consequently, the collective habitus of the field
strives for acceptance in the social sciences and social relevance
through knowledge production for the outside world.\footnote{Meyen,
  ``International Communication Association Fellows.''} The intense
public debates about populism, fake news, and hate speech, and ``the
growing realization among political scientists that discourse is crucial
for understanding populism,''\footnote{Claes de Vreese et al., ``Populism
  as an Expression of Political Communication Content and Style: A New
  Perspective,'' \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics} 23,
  no. 4 (2018).} provide an opportunity to increase the symbolic capital
of communication studies. This habitual disposition leads to a first
explanation for the sharp increase in the number of populism studies
from 2000 to 2022, as shown in figure 1 from the supply-side. Figure 2
illustrates the demand for populism studies in the field structure. The
table shows that Donald Trump is the most mentioned actor, with 1,002
mentions in the field of populism studies. Since Trump is rarely
mentioned before 2018 (10 mentions), the correlation between his victory
in the 2016 presidential election and the boom is evident and serves as
a showcase of the American universal in political communication and
elite journals, where the US context is treated as a norm and shapes the
expectations of scholars from other regions of the world.\footnote{Naiza
  Comel et al., ``Who Navigates the ``Elite'' of Communication Journals?
  The Participation of BRICS Universities in Top-Ranked Publications,''
  \emph{Online Media and Global Communication} 2, no. 4 (2023).} While
leaders such as Haider, Le Pen, Fortuyn, and Berlusconi have played a
significant role in European politics since the 1990s, the term populism
needed a US trigger to gain attention and acceptance in the major
international journals we surveyed. Consequently, mentions of the
European political parties AfD (159) and SVP (55) or the leaders Matteo
Salvini (141) and Geert Wilders (76) trail Trump's mentions by a wide
margin. Regardless of the geographical context, figure 2 shows that for
the components of populist communication,\footnote{de Vreese et al.,
  ``Populism as an Expression of Political Communication Content and
  Style.''} the research problem is right-wing populism (782) and, to a
lesser extent, left-wing populism (141) and anti-elite populism (76).
The most mentioned communication channels in the context of populism are
Facebook (495), Twitter (451), and 4/8chan (110), followed by the
traditional media FOX News (50).

When can we speak of a field? Bourdieu compares social fields to
magnetic force fields in which individuals attract and repel each other
like electrons. The actors, in our case the researchers, develop a
``secret complicity'' in the field, even without knowing or citing each
other, and engage in a knowledge struggle to determine the legitimate
points of view---in our case concerning the definition and
conceptualization of the phenomenon of populism.\footnote{Bourdieu and
  Wacquant, \emph{Reflexive Sociology.}} Like major universities, major
journals are linked by objective relations, so that a change in the
structure of these relations has an effect within each of
them.\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Homo Academicus.}} The emergence and
limits of the field can only be determined empirically, which makes the
research process a game of back and forth. To distinguish between a
pre-field and the field of study, in \emph{The Rules of Art} Bourdieu
focuses on 1898, the year of the Dreyfus Affair in France, when Émile
Zola\textquotesingle s work ``J\textquotesingle accuse'' embodied the
growing autonomy of the literary field from politics.\footnote{Bourdieu,
  \emph{The Rules of the Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary
  Field} (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996).} In a pragmatic
modification, we choose Trump\textquotesingle s election in 2016 as the
tipping point and divide our analysis into the pre-field of populism
studies from 2000 to 2017 and the field itself from 2018 to 2022. In
addition to the proliferation of studies, the following presentation
will show that, since 2018, research on populism has been limited to the
context of populist movements, and as a result of knowledge struggles,
we will get a dominant definition of populism, leading to the
autonomization of the field and increasing the stakes of entering the
field with differing approaches.

}{Pre-field of Populism Studies from 2000--2017 }}\label{pre-field-of-populism-studies-from-20002017}}

From 2000 to 2017, twenty-eight studies with the word ``populism'' or
``populist'' in the title, abstract, or keyword were published in the
six journals examined. Based on the varying definitions of the term
populism, the pre-field first shows why populism has long been
considered a notoriously vague and slippery concept.\footnote{Anastasia
  Kavada, ``Editorial: Media and the `Populist Moment,'\,'' \emph{Media,
  Culture \& Society} 40, no. 5 (2018).} A first group of scholars uses
the term in the context of \emph{critiques of modernization}, for
example of ``market populism,'' that is, the notion that the free market
is ``on the side of the ordinary people.''\footnote{Cathy Greenfield and
  Peter Williams, ``Financialization, Finance Rationality and the Role
  of Media in Australia,'' \emph{Media, Culture \& Society} 29, no. 3
  (2007); McKnight, ``The Sunday Times and Andrew Neil: The Cultivation
  of Market Populism,'' \emph{Journalism Studies} 10, no. 6 (2009);
  Reece Peck, ``\,`You Say Rich, I Say Job Creator': How Fox News Framed
  the Great Recession through the Moral Discourse of Producerism,''
  \emph{Media, Culture \& Society} 36, no. 4 (2014).} Other critiques
address the terms ``critical populism''\footnote{Joshua Gunn and Barry
  Brummett, ``Popular Communication after Globalization,'' \emph{Journal
  of Communication} 54, no. 4 (2004).} and ``techno-populism,'' the
latter of which seeks to glorify communication technology.\footnote{Paula
  Chakravartty, ``Telecom, National Development and the Indian State: A
  Postcolonial Critique,'' \emph{Media, Culture \& Society} 26, no. 2
  (2004); Bo Nilsson and Eric Carlsson, ``Swedish Politicians and New
  Media: Democracy, Identity and Populism in a Digital Discourse,''
  \emph{New Media \& Society} 16, no. 4 (2014); Tauel Harper, ``The Big
  Data Public and Its Problems: Big Data and the Structural
  Transformation of the Public Sphere,'' \emph{New Media \& Society} 19,
  no. 9 (2017).} The second group looks at populism in the context of
the \emph{commercialization} of the media and asks whether
``tabloidization'' is positive or negative for society.\footnote{Manuela
  Bueno, Maria Luisa Cárdenas, and Lola Esquivias, ``The Rise of the
  Gossip Press in Spain,'' \emph{Journalism Studies} 8, no. 4 (2007);
  Mary Debrett, ``Branding Documentary: New Zealand's Minimalist
  Solution to Cultural Subsidy,'' \emph{Media, Culture \& Society} 26,
  no. 1 (2004); Stephen Harrington, ``Waking up with Friends: Breakfast
  News, \emph{Sunrise} and the `Televisual Sphere,'\,'' \emph{Journalism
  Studies} 11, no. 2, (2010).} The third group explores the extent to
which \emph{digital technology} contributes to the rise of populist
movements.\footnote{Andrew Chadwick and Jennifer Stromer-Galley,
  ``Digital Media, Power, and Democracy in Parties and Election
  Campaigns: Party Decline or Party Renewal?'' \emph{The International
  Journal of Press/Politics} 21, no. 3 (2016); Niko Hatakka, ``When
  Logics of Party Politics and Online Activism Collide: The Populist
  Finns Party's Identity under Negotiation,'' \emph{New Media \&
  Society} 19, no. 12 (2017).} A fourth group identifies populist
\emph{communication styles} of ``aggressive journalists,''\textsuperscript{38} the regional
press,\textsuperscript{39} or
politicians.\textsuperscript{40} Comparing the impact of the groups,
figure 3 shows that ten studies on communication style (volume of 56.8)
and ten studies on critical theory (52.6) represent the dominant view on
the different concepts of populism. The contexts commercialization
(22.1) and digitalization (13.1) are comparatively low. Figure 3 shows
in addition the regional relationship between Anglophone countries and
the European Union (EU) with regard to publications. Studies containing
critical theory were mainly conducted at universities in the United
States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Australia, while studies focusing
on the other contexts are roughly evenly distributed across the regions.

Compared to the six journals studied, the Italian Gianpetro Mazzoleni
was the first to establish a connection between the media and political
populist movements with his essay ``Populism and the Media'' published
in a political science anthology.\textsuperscript{41}
In the later field of populism studies, Mazzoleni alone is cited 133
times. The twenty-one studies from the pre-field that do not cite
Mazzoleni are cited three times, uniquely by Chadwick and
Stromer-Galley.\textsuperscript{42} With this, the tradition of populism research
that criticizes modernization is disappearing---a tradition which the
seven studies that cite Mazzoleni and are highlighted in black do not
follow. Thus, in its socio-geographical genesis, the field of populism
studies is a mirror image of the overall field of communication studies,
where the socio-scientific paradigm travelled from the US to the rest of
the world.\textsuperscript{43} Although studies from Anglophone regions are
higher in numbers in the pre-field, it is the Europeans who bring the
quantitative method with media effects on a small range to the field.

\section{Mazzoleni's Framework}\label{mazzolenis-framework}}

Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s outstanding citation record points to a
theoretical center in the field of populism studies that offers
hypotheses for more than fifteen years of research. We present
Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s essay ``Populism and the Media'' in detail
because his framework serves as a basis for organizing the substantive
findings on the question of what causes populism. Mazzoleni adapts
political scientist Cas Mudde\textquotesingle s observation of a close
linkage between political populism and populist media, \footnote{Cas
  Mudde, ``The Populist Zeitgeist,'' \emph{Government \& Opposition} 39,
  no. 4 (2004).} creates the term media populism, combines the systemic
concept of mediatization with actor-centered ``populist strategies'' and
asks: ``Do the media contribute to the rise of populism?''\footnote{Mazzoleni,
  ``Populism and the Media,'' 50.} This question is the doxa of the
later field. In Mazzoleni's framework (figure 4), the potential cause of
mediatization (focus 1) is triggered by the ``global shift to an
infotainment society'' and the \emph{commercialization of media
systems}, making it the root of populism. To gain attention and public
goodwill, populist actors or parties (focus 2) or populist media (focus 3) employ two tactics. Distinguishing between these tactics is
essential for understanding the root cause. The first tactic involves
adapting to media logic (focus 4), for example, by means of criteria
such as creating sensations, controversy, drama, personality, or
visualization. This points toward commercialization as the cause of
populism. The second communication tactic (focus 5) is ``populism as a
communication style,'' which includes features such as ultra-simplified
messages, references to the people, playing the role of the underdog, or
aggressive attacks on the liberal media. If understood as an
ideology,\footnote{Mudde, ``The Populist Zeitgeist.''} populist style
can itself cause populist movements to emerge. In
Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s framework, journalists can be subject to a
\emph{production bias} (focus 6) or an \emph{evaluation bias} (focus 7).
The production bias means that journalists give populists more
opportunities to increase ratings. Empirical confirmation would support
the commercialization hypothesis as a cause of rising populism. The
evaluation bias means that journalists are naturally opposed to populist
ideas. Empirical confirmation of this would argue against mediatization
as a cause. The effects of media populism can be observed at three
levels: the media (focus 8), citizens (focus 9), or democracy (focus
10). Regarding the media complex, the effects can be identified through

\noindent an increase in \emph{media coverage} or through \emph{soft populism}
(focus 8b), i.e., non-populist politicians communicating in a more
populist manner. As for citizens (focus 9), increased \emph{attention}
to populists may lead to an identification with the ``populist stars''
(focus 9a) or to a \emph{change in attitudes} (focus 9b). Media populism
may have a negative impact on the ``health of Western democracies''
(focus 10) because shifts in attitudes could result in support for
\emph{nationalist and} \emph{xenophobic politics} in elections (focus
10a) or because public discourse undergoes \emph{contamination through}
\emph{populism} (focus 10b).




At the same time, Mazzoleni narrows down his concept: ``No assumption is
made here of a \emph{causal} \emph{link} between the media and the
spread of populism: The media factor, of course, is by no means the only
\textquotesingle independent variable\textquotesingle{} . . . and cannot
be separated from the other structural factors.''\footnote{Mazzoleni,
  ``Populism and the Media,'' 58.} The \emph{socio-structural factors}
(focus 11) are ``the nature of the political system and the specific
features of the social and cultural-political climates.''\footnote{Mazzoleni,
  58.} Causality can be tested using the ``media life-cycle model''
(focus 12) as such: If we first see an increase in coverage for
populists and then an increase in voting for populists, the
mediatization hypothesis is confirmed. But if populists first enter
parliaments and then increase their coverage, this argues against the
media as a driver of increasing populism.

\end{figure}


Mazzoleni does not mention neoliberalism as a possible cause, but at one
point he refers to the challenges of globalized capitalism. He also does
not mention \emph{digitalization} (focus 13) as a possible cause of
populism in 2008. Engesser and colleagues added this element later, in
an essay that is second only to Mazzoleni's inaugural essay in terms of
influence, with 118 citations in our investigated field of populism
studies (and, like Mazzoleni, was not published in any of the six
journals).\footnote{Engesser et al., ``Populism and Social Media.''}
They adopt Chadwick\textquotesingle s notion of a ``hybrid media
system''\footnote{Andrew Chadwick, \emph{The Hybrid Media System:
  Politics and Power} (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).} and
highlight the novelty: While populists can be critiqued by journalists
in traditional media, social media serves as a direct linkage to the
people and allows populists to circumvent the journalistic gatekeepers.
In the following, we will refer to populism\textquotesingle s ``affinity
for social media'' with the simplified term the \emph{digitalization
hypothesis}. The cause-and-effect chain of mediatization is the
\emph{commercialization hypothesis}. If the communication tactics of
focus 5 are foregrounded, the study addresses the \emph{style
hypothesis}.

\section{The Field of Populism and the Illusio of its Field of
Power}\label{the-field-of-populism-and-the-illusio-of-its-field-of-power}}

A total of eighty-six articles with the word ``populism'' or
``populist'' in the title, abstract, or keyword were published in the
six journals from 2018 to 2022. Fourteen of these articles examine
populism in non-Western systems, which we exclude to avoid the
complexity of comparing dissimilar systems.\footnote{Daniel C. Hallin
  and Paolo Mancini, eds., \emph{Comparing Media Systems Beyond the
  Western World} (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011).} If we
differentiate between the twenty-eight studies from the pre-field in
terms of whether they cite Mazzoleni or not, the difference that emerges
is that they either cite Mazzoleni and/or Mudde or they do not include
citations of the two authors at all. Indeed, Mudde, author of \emph{The}
\emph{Populist Zeitgeist},\footnote{Mudde, ``The Populist Zeitgeist.''}
has replaced Mazzoleni as the most cited researcher among populism
theorists, with 216 citations in our investigated field of populism. We
can consider Mazzoleni and Mudde as the same strain, since Mudde's
citations relate especially to foci 2, 4, and 5 in
Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s framework. Thirty-six empirical studies in
the field of populism studies follow the Mazzoleni-Mudde strain; we
capture them as the field of power and the orthodox group of actors.
Another twenty studies also examine populism empirically, but without
reference to Mazzoleni and Mudde. This is the heterodox group of actors.
As a third group, we identify a subfield of theorists represented by
fourteen studies in which the reflection takes an orthodox, heterodox,
or heretical position on the field of power. In addition, there are
three introductions for special issues on populism (marked in italics in
figure 5), which we assign to the field of power\footnote{de Vreese et
  al., ``Populism as an Expression of Political Communication Content
  and Style: A New Perspective''; Homero Gil de Zúñiga, Michalska Koc,
  and Andrea Römmele, ``Populism in the Era of Twitter: How Social Media
  Contextualized New Insights into an Old Phenomenon,'' \emph{New Media
  \& Society} 22, no. 4 (2020).} and theorists.\footnote{Kavada,
  ``Editorial.''}

Reflecting the dominant conception of populism, one publication is
representative of the field of power: the introduction for the special
issue of \emph{International Journal of Press/Politics}.\footnote{de
  Vreese et al., ``Populism as an Expression of Political Communication
  Content and Style: A New Perspective.''} The text may not achieve the
highest number of citations in the investigated field, but it is
authored by five ``patrons'': de Vreese (87 citations), Esser (105),
Aalberg (79), Reinemann (35), and Stanyer (18). All are professors with
power over research funds, and their essay provides a ``conceptual basis
for a new generation of populism researchers.''\footnote{de Vreese et
  al., 425.} The call for this special issue attracted more than seventy
submissions. In their conception of populism, de Vreese combines
Mudde\textquotesingle s ideology-centered and
Hawkin\textquotesingle s\footnote{Kirk A. Hawkins,
  \emph{Venezuela\textquotesingle s Chavismo and Populism in Comparative
  Perspective} (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010).}
discourse-centered understanding of populism as an expression of
\emph{political communication content and style}. With respect to the
causes of populism, the authors refer to the exogenous factors of
``economic insecurity''\footnote{Gwartney et al., ``Economic Freedom of
  the World.''} and ``cultural backlash.''\footnote{Inglehart and Norris,
  ``Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism.''} And yet, like
Krämer\footnote{Benjamin Krämer, ``Media Populism: A Conceptual
  Clarification and Some Theses on its Effects: Media Populism,''
  \emph{Communication Theory} 24, no. 1 (2014).}---the most cited
scholar in the pre-field with 112 citations, who defined media populism
as a phenomenology---the authors note: ``We are not so much concerned
with a normative assessment of opportunity structures.''\footnote{de
  Vreese et al., 425.} This focus on populist communication specifies
the illusio in the field of power. The doxa in the field as a whole is
based on the question ``Do the media contribute to the rise of
populism?'' Considering the most studied form of right-wing populism, as
explained above, and the essay by Engesser and colleagues\footnote{Engesser
  et al., ``Populism and Social Media.''} on digitalization, which has
been cited 118 times, the illusio of the field of power becomes: Does
populist communication style and content contribute to the rise of
right-wing populism through (social) media?

\hypertarget{structure-of-the-field-positions-and-results}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{Structure of the Field, Positions, and
Results
}{Structure of the Field, Positions, and Results }}\label{structure-of-the-field-positions-and-results}}

We propose structuring the field of populism studies following the
classical structure of a field analysis. The ``top versus bottom'' will
be determined based on the volume of symbolic capital, which is the
aggregated cultural-specific, social, and economic capital. To implement
symbolic capital empirically, we will use the journal\textquotesingle s
five-year impact factor. The ``left-right scheme'' of the field will be
arranged according to the relationship between the types of capital. In
his graphic representations, Bourdieu reduces the three types of capital
to the opposition between economic capital and culture-specific capital.
In the university field, culture-specific capital is scientific capital.
Thus, in figure 5, we structure the field based on two factors: economic
capital (EC) and scientific capital (SC). The right side of the field is
the heteronomous pole, which is more open to logic from outside of the
field and influences from other social fields such as politics,
economics, or the media.\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Rules of the Art.}}
The left side is the autonomous pole, where the actors orient themselves
more strongly to the internal logic of the field. In \emph{Homo
Academicus}, Bourdieu compares science to a ``parliament of
scholarship.''\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Homo Academicus}, 88.} The
authority sits on the right, implementing the techniques and rules of
science within the framework of the existing social order. The
opposition party sits on the left, responding to practical matters on
the social level by making interjections. We locate the critique of
neoliberalism, presented as the cause of populism, at the autonomous
pole. Then, from left to right, the contexts of populism---social
structures, mediatization, digitalization, and populist style---follow.
The contexts of mediatization, digitalization, and style have penetrated
the academic field from the outside---clear evidence that the growth of
the field of populism studies is not due to Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s
theoretical innovation within the field in 2008. Instead, the field
boomed in 2018 as a result of Trump\textquotesingle s election, which
took place outside the field, with the much-discussed question of
whether Facebook or Twitter contributed to his victory.

We specify the studies in the field of power using
Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s thirteen foci. Like de Vreese et
al.,\footnote{de Vreese et al., ``Populism as an Expression of Political
  Communication Content and Style.''} we group these foci together under
the following complexes: ``political actors'' (foci 2, 4, 5, 13),
``media'' (foci 1, 3, 6--8, 12), and ``citizens'' (foci 9--11). The
color coding in figure 5 is based on the empirical results. Green stands
for studies containing results that support the field of power's illusio
that style combined with digitalization fuels right-wing populism. Red
represents studies that contradict the field's doxa that style,
digitalization, \emph{or} mediatization contribute to the rise of
populism. Blue represents studies that do not confirm the style and
digitalization hypotheses but point toward the commercialization
hypothesis in the context of mediatization. Gray represents studies that
do not confirm the digitalization hypothesis but report that
digitalization has had another effect on society than right-wing
populism. Purple stands for studies that do not confirm the style
hypothesis but report that populist style has had another effect than
right-wing populism. The studies that do not examine the effect of
populist communication but explore \emph{how} populists communicate are
highlighted in black. Studies that explicitly set a ``counter frame'' to
the digitalization hypothesis are highlighted in yellow. Taken together,
the seventy-three studies from the field of populism have an impact
volume of 424.3, published by 192 authors. The thirty-eight studies in
the field of power have an impact volume of 236.5 (137 authors), and the
twenty studies in the heterodox actor group have an impact volume of
110.8 (36 authors). The fifteen theoretic articles have an impact volume
of 77 (19 authors). Regarding the vertical hierarchy within the actor
groups, the studies are classified according to their specific journal
impact. For instance, a study published in the \emph{Journal of
Communication} (impact 9.5) is positioned higher than a study in
\emph{Media, Culture \& Society} (3.1). If two studies are published in
the same journal, the older study is positioned above the more recent
one, as it is assumed to have a higher long-term impact.

\hypertarget{the-field-of-power}{%
\section{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{The Field of
Power}\label{the-field-of-power}}

In the field of power, there are fifteen studies in the ``populist
actor'' complex that propose hypotheses regarding style and
digitalization, eight studies in the ``media'' complex that investigate
the commercialization hypothesis, and thirteen studies in the
``citizen'' complex that examine the effects of populist communication
within the framework of all three hypotheses. The key findings are
positioned from left to right in the field graph.

\hypertarget{actor-complex}{%
\subsection{Actor
Complex}\label{actor-complex}}

Since Mazzoleni identified politicians and parties as populist actors in
his 2008 essay, new actors have emerged by way of the internet (focus
2). In social networks, for example, we experience populism ``by
citizens,''\footnote{Sina Blassnig et al., ``Populism in Online Election
  Coverage: Analyzing Populist Statements by Politicians, Journalists,
  and Readers in Three Countries,'' \emph{Journalism Studies} 20, no. 8

``hyperpartisan media.''\footnote{Anders O. Larsson, ``Right-Wingers on
  the Rise Online: Insights from the 2018 Swedish Elections,'' \emph{New
  Media \& Society} 22, no. 12 (2020).} Studies on the communication
forms of \emph{a priori defined populists} focus on style and content
(focus 5). Populists are more likely to talk about
corruption,\footnote{Kaitlen J. Cassell, ``The Populist Communication

Twitter.\textsuperscript{78} These higher levels of
engagement (focus 9a) point toward the ``social media affinity'' of
populism. However, the findings of a study \emph{without an a priori
classification} of populists paint a different picture. In twenty-six
countries analyzed, only four percent of political leaders' Facebook
posts contain at least one element of populist communication. Thus,
``the populist zeitgeist \textquotesingle thesis\textquotesingle{}
{[}focus 8a{]} does not apply to communication strategies.''\textsuperscript{79} A comparison of
communication channels that includes talk shows, Twitter, Facebook, and
the news media reveals that: ``It is the newspapers of all places where
we found the highest proportion of populist statements.''\textsuperscript{80} Populists can make a breakthrough into traditional media
through social media, but a comparison of communication tactics shows
that their reason for doing so is not populist style, but ``the
so-called news value bonus because their messages are controversial,
spectacular, and taboo-breaking---and thus meet the selection criteria
of the media.''\textsuperscript{81} Bucy and colleagues\textsuperscript{82} and Wells and colleagues\textsuperscript{83}
also show that media logic is crucial for the transfer from social media
to traditional media. With regard to traditional media, leaders of the
German right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) have received much
more news media coverage about their provocation (``content that
perfectly matches media logic'') than about their attacks on political
elites as an element of populist style.\textsuperscript{84} As Strikovic et al. note,
``Politicians are not becoming more populist across the political
spectrum, but rather there is a tendency toward personalization, which
makes \textquotesingle normal\textquotesingle{} political communication
appear more populist.''\textsuperscript{85} summary, the results from the political actor complex do not
support the hypothesis that digitalization and style are the drivers of
populism. As the elements of\marginnote{\textsuperscript{77} Anders O. Larsson,

\subsection{Media
Complex}\label{media-complex}}

We can continue to test this commercialization hypothesis in the media
complex, which comprises eight studies. In addition, the studies of Wirz
and colleagues\footnote{Dominique S. Wirz et al., ``The Effects of
  Right-Wing Populist Communication on Emotions and Cognitions toward
  Immigrants,'' \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics} 23,
  no. 4 (2018).} from the citizen complex and of Müller and
colleagues\footnote{Philipp Müller et al., ``The Polarizing Impact of
  News Coverage on Populist Attitudes in the Public: Evidence from a
  Panel Study in Four European Democracies: Polarizing News Effects on
  Populist Attitudes,'' \emph{Journal of Communication} 67, no. 6
  (2017).} from the pre-field are included in this analysis, as they
report results of content analyses conducted in parallel.

One study supports the populist zeitgeist thesis of \emph{populism by
the media} (focus 3). Focusing on a twenty-eight-year period of media
coverage (focus 8a) in the Netherlands, Hameleers and Vliegenthart
observe ``clear evidence for an increasing presence of people-centric,
anti-elitist and right- and left-exclusionist coverage in
newspapers.''\textsuperscript{89} However, they put these
findings into perspective. First, ``populist rhetoric is not as overtly
dominant in media coverage,'' and, second, ``we may not be able to
establish a clear causal relationship between the increasing trend of
populist references in media coverage and increasing support for
populist ideas and parties in public opinion.''\textsuperscript{90} Causality can be tested using
Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s \emph{media life cycle model} (focus 12) and
four content analyses of news coverage in Northern and Central European
Countries.\textsuperscript{91}
In an international comparison, all four studies show that in countries
where populist parties have been present in parliament for a longer
period of time and are thus in the zone of legitimate controversy,
populist themes, messages, or intra-media agenda-setting are more
prevalent in print media. In terms of causality, this suggests that the
media are not the driver of a possible populist zeitgeist but that they
\emph{follow} it. The studies also show that coverage is rather low in
absolute terms (focus 8a): ``In contrast to many allegations regarding
the news media following the last European elections, Brexit, and the
election of Trump . . . we found populist actors (on the left and right)
to be mostly \emph{underrepresented}.''\textsuperscript{92} ``Only a small share of
articles'' contained statements that can be considered
populist.\textsuperscript{93} ``Most articles had no or few (populist) style
elements'' and ``anti-immigrant statements were relatively
scarce.''\textsuperscript{94}

Thus, according to the results, journalists are not subject to a
\emph{production bias} (focus 6), but rather are subject to an
\emph{evaluation bias} (focus 7). Regarding comments on populist
alternative media ``the overwhelmingly negative coverage implies that
the mainstream media is fulfilling its democratic role by informing and
promoting public understanding of the motives and ideological views of
right-wing alternative\marginnote{\textsuperscript{89} Michael Hameleers and Rens Vliegenthart, ``The

show that the \emph{evaluation bias} is weaker owing to the electoral
success of populists,\footnote{Ayala Panievsky, ``The Strategic Bias:
  How Journalists Respond to Antimedia Populism,'' \emph{The
  International Journal of Press/Politics} 27, no. 4 (2022); Léonie de
  Jonge, ``The Populist Radical Right and the Media in the Benelux:
  Friend or Foe?'' \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics}
  24, no. 2 (2019).} the effects are evident on both private and public
media journalists. This means that ``the differences in media strategies
cannot simply be attributed to commercialization.''\footnote{de Jonge,
  ``The Populist Radical Right and the Media in the Benelux,'' 205.}
Overall, we endorse the conclusion of Wettstein and colleagues regarding
the media complex:

\begin{quote}
The media have been criticized for providing a favorable stage for
populist actors, and---bluntly said--- falling victim to the news value
bonus and provocative strategies of populist actors whose main goal is
to trigger news coverage, polarize the electorate and mobilize their own
supporters. Although the theoretical argument sounds plausible, we do
not find convincing empirical support for it. . . . The term ``media
populism'' should be used with reservation.\footnote{Wettstein et al.,
  ``News Media as Gatekeepers,'' 490--91.}
\end{quote}

\noindent Mazzoleni asked the question: ``Do the media contribute to the rise of
populism?'' We propose formulating the question differently based on our
findings:

To what extent do the media contribute to the downplay of populism?

In the citizen complex, the study reporting the largest proven media
effect in the field of populism studies also suggests that the question
should be posed this way. Boukes and Hameleers show that satire shows
broadcast by mainstream media reduced support for Dutch right-wing
populist Geert Wilders among viewers (focus 9b).\footnote{Marc Boukes
  and Michael Hameleers, ``Shattering Populists' Rhetoric with Satire at
  Elections Times: The Effect of Humorously Holding Populists
  Accountable for Their Lack of Solutions,'' \emph{Journal of
  Communication} 70, no. 4 (2020).} Thus, this result also belies the
hypothesis that media contribute to the rise of populism.

\hypertarget{citizen-complex}{%
\subsection{Citizen Complex}
}\label{citizen-complex}

Of the thirteen studies in the citizen complex, three studies examine
the behavior of online users and ten studies examine the effects of
populist communication and include sociodemographic characteristics such
as gender, age, education, or income. Hameleers and colleagues
investigate social structures in the most depth, also including country
structure data: unemployment and migration levels.\footnote{Michael
  Hameleers et al., ``Start Spreading the News: A Comparative Experiment
  on the Effects of Populist Communication on Political Engagement in
  Sixteen European Countries,'' \emph{The International Journal of
  Press/Politics} 23, no. 4 (2018).} We will first present the effects
of populist communication on citizens\textquotesingle{} attitudes (focus
9) and then its effects on democracy (focus 10).

The results of the studies with real-life settings are consistent with
those of experimental studies, and one aspect stands out: ``The
influence of populist statements depends on media
users\textquotesingle{} prior attitudes''\footnote{Michael Hameleers,
  Linda Bos, and Claes H. de Vreese, ``Selective Exposure to Populist
  Communication: How Attitudinal Congruence Drives the Effects of
  Populist Attributions of Blame,'' \emph{Journal of Communication} 68,
  no. 1 (2018b): 69.} or comes ``on top of pre-existing
attitudes.''\textsuperscript{102}
Effects are evident among people who feel relatively
deprived,\textsuperscript{103} who already hold populist attitudes,\textsuperscript{104} who
are disappointed by politics,\textsuperscript{105} or who
hold anti-pluralistic world views.\textsuperscript{106} At the same time, the findings\marginnote{\textsuperscript{102} Wirz et al., ``The Effects of Right-Wing Populist

low (between 1 and 2\%)''\footnote{Müller et al., ``The Polarizing Impact
  of News Coverage,'' 987.} or ``only explain between 1\% and 3\% of the
variance.''\footnote{Egelhofer et al., ``Populist Attitudes and
  Politicians' Disinformation Accusations,'' 8.} In other words,
populist messages do not lead to an increase in right-wing populist
attitudes, but they can have a reinforcing effect in experimental tests.
What is a reinforcing effect?

To understand what a reinforcing effect is in this context, we have to
look more closely at the individual components of populist
communication. The three components of \emph{populism as a communication
style} are ``references to the people,'' ``anti-elitism,'' and
``anti-out-groups.''\footnote{de Vreese et al., ``Populism as an
  Expression of Political Communication Content and Style.''} The
methodological key result is that the components only have a significant
effect when they are combined.\footnote{Hameleers et al., ``Start
  Spreading the News.''} In all the studies examined, it is clear which
component is the key driver: ``A systematic relation could only be found
for anti-elite populism, which includes both right- and left-wing
populism.''\footnote{Fawzi, ``Untrustworthy News and the Media as `Enemy
  of the People?'\,''} The anti-elite factor is also most frequently
found in reader comments\footnote{Blassnig et al., ``Populism in Online
  Election Coverage.''} and social media likes.\footnote{Giuliano Bobba
  et al., ``Populism and the Gender Gap: Comparing Digital Engagement
  with Populist and Non-Populist Facebook Pages in France, Italy, and
  Spain,'' \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics} 23, no. 4
  (2018).} In the field of populism studies, the research problem (see
above) is ``right-wing populism'' (766 mentions), while anti-elite
populism receives less attention (76 mentions). However, the results
make it clear that anti-elite populism is the more socially relevant
phenomenon. While the anti-elite component has the strongest mobilizing
effect, the anti-out-group factor can trigger a reaction and have a
demobilizing effect.\footnote{Hameleers et al., ``Selective Exposure to
  Populist Communication''; Müller et al., ``The Polarizing Impact of
  News Coverage.''} Hence, the possible effect of populist communication
for democracy (focus 10) is not an increase in right-wing populist
attitudes. Rather, populist communication might have a \emph{polarizing
effect}, widening gaps in society and increasing the problem of
fragmented populations in democratic systems.\footnote{Hameleers et al.,
  ``Selective Exposure to Populist Communication''; Müller et al., ``The
  Polarizing Impact of News Coverage.''}

Supposed social polarization caused by populist communication is
connected to the digitalization hypothesis (focus 13) as well as to the
concern that public discourse is being contaminated by populism (focus
10b). One fear is that populist alternative media could displace the
legacy press. However, these concerns are ``unwarranted.''\footnote{Sebastian
  Stier et al., ``Populist Attitudes and Selective Exposure to Online
  News: A Cross-Country Analysis Combining Web Tracking and Surveys,''
  \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics} 25, no. 3 (2020).}
Legacy press outlets are notably dominant---consumed nineteen times as
much as hyper-partisan news sources, even by citizens with populist
attitudes in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the
US.\footnote{Stier et al., ``Populist Attitudes and Selective
  Exposure.''} The exposure to populist alternative news among voters of
the German AfD party is relatively low,\textsuperscript{118} and
legacy news media are still highly influential in a right-wing online
forum in Spain.\textsuperscript{119}
A closer look at the results reveals a difference between researchers
from North American universities and those from continental European
universities. Two German research teams reach a similar conclusion: As
people with populist attitudes still consume more alternative media than
people without populist attitudes, alternative media could have a
polarizing effect and pose a threat to liberal democracies.\textsuperscript{120} At a US university, on the other hand, Juarez Miro
and Toff present\marginnote{\textsuperscript{118} Philipp Müller and
  Ruben L. Bach, ``Populist Alternative News Use and Its Role for
  Elections: Web-Tracking and Survey Evidence from Two Campaign
  Periods,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}, Online First (2021).} ``a\marginnote{\textsuperscript{119} Juarez Miro and Toff, ``How Right-Wing

  Stier et al., ``Populist Attitudes and Selective Exposure to Online
  News''; Müller and Bach, ``Populist Alternative News Use and Its Role

digital media platforms as places where people with like-minded views
solely engage with a narrow range of information sources.''\footnote{Juarez
  Miro and Toff, ``How Right-Wing Populists Engage with Cross-Cutting
  News on Online Message Boards,'' 14.} Their result regarding a
right-wing online forum suggests that the discussions there ``resemble
normatively positive deliberative spaces---albeit in this case in
support of illiberal political positions.''\footnote{Juarez Miro and
  Toff, 1.} At a university in Canada, Bouliane and colleagues make a
distinction within the polarization thesis using right-wing echo
chambers from the internet: The effects of informational similarity
``are online not more than offline'' and ``could push all citizens
{[}socialists, Greens, and others{]} towards extremes.''\footnote{Shelley
  Boulianne, Karolina Koc-Michalska, and Bruce Bimber, ``Right-Wing
  Populism, Social Media and Echo Chambers in Western Democracies,''
  \emph{New Media \& Society} 22, no. 4 (2020): 695.} Their key finding
on the digitalization hypotheses is:

\begin{quote}
Overall, we do not find evidence that online/social media explain
support for right-wing populist candidates and parties. Instead, in the
United States, use of online media \emph{decreases} support for
right-wing populism.\footnote{Boulianne et al., 683, emphasis added.}
\end{quote}

\noindent Therefore, it should be noted that the results in the field of power
provide little evidence for the digitalization and style hypothesis.
While the effects of populist messages and their share in the media are
always small and require interpretation in order to weight them, the
results for the connection between social determinants and populist
attitudes are clear (focus 10). People with a lower income, a lower
education, and a higher age are more likely to hold populist
attitudes.\footnote{Müller et al., ``The Polarizing Impact of News
  Coverage''; Fawzi, ``Untrustworthy News and the Media as `Enemy of the
  People?'\,''; Stier et al., ``Populist Attitudes and Selective
  Exposure to Online News''; Müller and Bach, ``Populist Alternative
  News Use and Its Role for Elections.''} Male gender is also a strong
predictor of populist behavior online.\footnote{Bobba et al., ``Populism
  and the Gender Gap.''} The sixteen-country experiment by Hameleers
with twenty-eight co-authors,\footnote{Hameleers et al., ``Start
  Spreading the News.''} which examines social structure in most depth,
shows that ``populist communication . . . resonates with the opportunity
structures in countries.''\footnote{Hameleers et al., 533.} The
motivating potential of populist messages increases with the
\emph{national level of unemployment} and the \emph{overall}
\emph{political climate}, while with regard to the \emph{level of
immigration} of a country there is ``clearly no impact of populist cues
on political engagement.''\footnote{Hameleers et al., 531.} This result
also suggests that anti-elite populism, and not right-wing populism, is
the crucial component for the rise of populist movements. Anti-elite
populism is caused by a sense of social insecurity, which leads us to
neoliberalism as a driver in the final section. How is the question of
cause negotiated in the heterodox field of populism studies?

\hypertarget{heterodox-group}{%
\section{Heterodox Group}\label{heterodox-group}}

In the heterodox field, almost all studies\footnote{An exception to this
  is Leon A. Salter, ``Editorial Representations of the National
  Standards Education Policy: Populism, the Journalistic Identity and
  the Citizen-Consumer,'' Journalism Studies 20, no. 7 (2019).} are in
the context of the field's doxa: ``Do the media contribute to the rise
of populism?'' However, they use different definitions of populism,
which is why the term sometimes becomes a slippery concept again. Ten
studies examine populism in the context of digital media, ten studies in
the context of traditional media. The digitalization studies differ from
those in the field of power insofar as they all relate the rise in
populism to changes in social structures and include socio-demographic
variables and/or set a counter frame to the digitalization hypothesis.
We order the studies between the autonomous and heteronomous poles,
depending on the factor that the author highlights as the strongest
cause of populism. Four studies highlight digitalization as a key factor
in the rise of populism. For instance, the memes posted on the board of
right-wing populist network 4chan contribute to the normalization of
antisemitic content;\footnote{Marc Tuters and Sal Hagen, ``(((They)))
  Rule: Memetic Antagonism and Nebulous Othering on 4chan,'' \emph{New
  Media \& Society} 22, no. 12 (2020).} follower networks of the
right-wing AfD might increase polarization;\footnote{Felix Rusche, ``Few
  Voices, Strong Echo: Measuring Follower Homogeneity of Politicians'
  Twitter Accounts,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}, Online First (2022).}
Russia Today (RT) conveys an anti-elite worldview to youth in Western
democracies;\footnote{Robert A. Saunders et al., ``ICYMI: RT and
  Youth-Oriented International Broadcasting as (Geo)Political Culture
  Jamming,'' \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics} 27, no.
  3 (2022).} and journalists should exercise caution when including
populist leaders\textquotesingle{} tweets in their reports.\footnote{Delia
  Dumitrescu and Andrew R. Ross, ``Embedding, Quoting, or Paraphrasing?
  Investigating the Effects of Political Leaders' Tweets in Online News
  Articles: The Case of Donald Trump,'' \emph{New Media \& Society} 23,
  no. 8 (2021).} The commercialization hypothesis emerges as the
strongest in four studies in the heterodox field. In this group, the
one-media fallacy\footnote{Elizabeth Poole et al., ``Tactical
  Interventions in Online Hate Speech: The Case of \#stopIslam,''
  \emph{New Media \& Society} 23, no. 6 (2021).} in the field of
communication studies and Mudde\textquotesingle s ``thin-centered''
definition of populism\footnote{Jessica Baldwin-Philippi, ``The
  Technological Performance of Populism,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}
  21, no. 2 (2019).} are criticized. Communication studies should
instead focus on the economic relations of social platforms\footnote{Brian
  Judge, ``The Birth of Identity Biopolitics: How Social Media Serves
  Antiliberal Populism,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}, Online First
  (2022).} and on the reduction of media owners' influence, as mediated
populism has existed for decades in the US via talk radios or Fox
News.\footnote{Chuck Tryon, ``Sinclair Broadcasting as Mini-Media
  Empire: Media regulation, Disinfomercials, and the Rise of Trumpism,''
  \emph{Media, Culture \& Society} 42, no. 7 (2020).}

Seven studies of the heteronomous field highlight changes in social
structures as a major factor in the rise of populism. In this group, the
study of McDevitt and Ferrucci provides especially clear empirical
evidence for our ordering of the causes of populism between the
autonomous-scientific and heteronomous poles. They compared the
explanations of Trump's victory in 2016. While scholars mostly viewed
his rise as predictable when considering journalists\textquotesingle{}
low level of interest in rural communities and misunderstanding of
populism, the journalists from outside the field implicitly argued that
his victory was facilitated by the media illiteracy of citizens who were
unable to resist fake news.\footnote{Michael McDevitt and Patrick
  Ferrucci, ``Populism, Journalism, and the Limits of Reflexivity: The
  Case of Donald J. Trump,'' \emph{Journalism Studies} 19, no. 4 (2018).}
But, as further studies show, the frequent call for more media literacy
is not a promising solution to the post-truth dilemma, as the media
literacy of people using the 8chan imageboard of the right-wing
conspiracy QAnon is relatively high.\footnote{Alice Marwick and William
  Clyde Partin, ``Constructing Alternative Facts: Populist Expertise and
  the QAnon Conspiracy,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}, Online First
  (2022).} Newspapers taking a direct stand against Trump potentially
reinforced his ``fake news'' and ``enemy of the people''
rhetoric.\textsuperscript{138} Instead of
social media, television news continues to play a major role in rural
areas, with the critical components: the anti-elite ethos and widespread
democratic dissatisfaction\textsuperscript{139} that populist projects turn into
political power.\textsuperscript{140} An example of such a populist project is Trump's
concept-metaphor of the border.\textsuperscript{141} Five studies in the heterodox\marginnote{\textsuperscript{138} Regina G. Lawrence and Young Eun Moon, ``\,`We Aren't

  (2022).} global
capitalism or neoliberalism as a decisive factor in the rise of
populism. They report that the term populism is used in the legacy media
to defend the status quo of liberal democracy. But as populism ``is a
reaction to collapsed financial capitalism, the label masks a deeper
conversation.''\footnote{Stephanie Brookes, ``What Do We Mean When We
  Talk about Populism? Local Politics, Global Movements and `The People'

  Populism: Populism as a Signifier in Legacy Dailies of Six Countries
  2000--2018,'' \emph{Media, Culture \& Society} 44, no. 8 (2022).}
Similarly, the anti-elite populism of Lady Gaga and Greta Thunberg on
Instagram prevents a serious debate about the effects of
neoliberalism,\footnote{Antonio Kissas, ``Populist Everyday Politics in
  the (Mediatized) Age of Social Media: The Case of Instagram Celebrity
  Advocacy,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}, Online First (2022).} but
``theorizing economic globalization is vital'' for understanding

  coverage, see Leon A. Salter, ``Editorial Representations of the
  National Standards Education Policy: Populism, the Journalistic
  Identity and the Citizen-Consumer,'' \emph{Journalism Studies} 20, no.
  7 (2019).} Thus, in the aggregate, the heteronomous field is
positioned further to the left than the field of power.

\hypertarget{theorists}{%
\section{Theorists}\label{theorists}}

The essays in the sub-field of the theorists have one thing in common.
Several possible factors are always raised when examining the cause of
populism, ``as the transition is a complex and multi-faceted
one.''\footnote{Andrea Roemmele and Rachel Gibson, ``Scientific and
  Subversive: The Two Faces of the Fourth Era of Political
  Campaigning,'' \emph{New Media \& Society} 22, no. 4 (2020): 599.} The
following representation ranks the studies according to the factor that
authors address most strongly in their reflection. Five studies come
closest to the digitalization hypothesis. In this group the
``affordances framework'' serves to highlight how social media provide
opportunities for populists.\footnote{Bruce Bimber and Homero Gil de
  Zúñiga, ``The Unedited Public Sphere,'' \emph{New Media \& Society}
  22, no. 4 (2020); Jeroen Hopster\textbf{,} ``Mutual Affordances: The
  Dynamics between Social Media and Populism,'' \emph{Media, Culture \&
  Society} 43, no. 3 (2021).} Furthermore, digital media have played an
important role for mediated populism,\textsuperscript{147} the spread of reactionary
populism,\textsuperscript{148} and voting for
Trump.\textsuperscript{149}
One study by the theorists supports the commercialization hypothesis,
emphasizing platform economy in the post-public sphere.\textsuperscript{150} Five theorists highlight changes in
social structures as a key factor, explicitly criticizing the ``doxa''
in populism research\textsuperscript{151}
and the ``highly moralistic condemnation of right-wing populist
movements'' in academic discourses.\textsuperscript{152} As there is a constant collective
populist identity in societies,\textsuperscript{153} the field of populism
studies needs a ``thicker'' concept to judge the impact of
populism\textsuperscript{154} and critical social
theory to explore the economic and political factors promoting
mistrust.\textsuperscript{155} This call was
preceded by a contribution by four theorists focusing on the impact of
neoliberalism in a special issue of \emph{Media, Culture \& Society}. In
a ``provocative essay,''\textsuperscript{156} Gerbaudo
criticizes Mudde\textquotesingle s definition of populism: ``It does not
address the root causes behind this surge and the failings of the
neoliberal system that have engendered widespread discontent.'' Instead,
``key for a perceptive understanding of populism is the work of Ernesto
Laclau.''\textsuperscript{157} The critical perspective encompasses nuanced views:
``The \textquotesingle It\textquotesingle s the neoliberal economy,
stupid\textquotesingle{} refrain is common among contemporary analysts
of the phenomenon . . . but we need to add the \textquotesingle cultural
backlash thesis,'\,''\textsuperscript{158} and the political left has to ``come up with
proper responses.''\textsuperscript{159} Yet,

\section{Habitus and its
Characteristics}\label{habitus-and-its-characteristics}}

In figure 6, we highlight the characteristics of the habitus of populism
studies with respect to five focal points: style and digitalization,
commercialization, style with structural data, social structures, and
neoliberalism. We have reduced the complex tool of habitus to its
characteristics: journal, nationality, theory, method, funding, year.
The results of the studies reveal a gap between the evidence and the
impact in the field. The twenty-six studies from all three actor groups
that examine populism combined with digitalization and/or style have the
highest impact volume by far: 169.4 out of the total 424.3. The thirteen
studies from the field of power that examine the effects of populist
communication in the citizen complex have an impact volume of 85.5. This
is followed by the commercialization hypothesis, with a total impact
volume of 69.4 in thirteen studies and across all three groups of
actors. The twelve studies by the theorists and heterodox scholars who
highlight socio-structural causes as the main drivers of populism have
an impact volume of 66.8. The nine out of the seventy-three studies in
the field of Western populism that propose neoliberalism as the cause of
populism have by far the lowest impact volume in the field, 33.2. In
addition, a comparison of the average impact of the individual studies
reveals that the studies addressing neoliberalism clearly have the
lowest impact: 3.7. Here, the effect studies from the field of power
have the highest average impact of 6.6 (and are positioned at the top in
the middle of the field, like in an ideal-typical conception of the
field). This focus is followed by digitalization and style (average
6.5), social structures (average 5.6), and commercialization (average
5.3). This demonstrates that, strategically, it is least worthwhile for
researchers to explore populism in the context of neoliberalism. The
impact factor is, of course, inextricably linked to the journal. The
greatest contrast in the field of populism studies is between
\emph{Media, Culture \& Society} and \emph{New Media \& Society}. Of a
total of twenty-six studies highlighting digitalization and/or style as
drivers of populism, sixteen were published in \emph{New Media \&
Society}. Seven of the nine studies conducted in the context of
neoliberalism were published in \emph{Media, Culture \& Society}. Thus,
the effect of the journal is most pronounced with regard to studies on
the causes of populism here. In the \emph{International} \emph{Journal
of Press/Politics}, the context of populism style with structural data
(seven out of twenty-three studies) is slightly ahead of the
commercialization hypothesis (six out of twenty-three studies). The
\emph{Journal of Communication}, on the other hand, appears to focus on
the effects of populist communication with structural data (three out of
four studies). \emph{Communication Theory} consistently highlights
social structures as the strongest driver of populism (four out of four
studies). In the ten studies published in \emph{Journalism Studies}, the
focus is equally distributed across all contexts of populism. The
context of neoliberalism is not mentioned in any study published in the
\emph{Journal of Communication}, \emph{Communication Theory}, and the
\emph{International Journal of Press/Politics}. Hence, based on the
impact-evidence gap, we observe a second key phenomenon in the field of
populism research: a complete void of studies addressing neoliberalism
and social structures as causes of populism in the field of power.

Authors}
}\label{characteristics-theory-method-authors}

In the field of power, the application of Mudde\textquotesingle s
theoretical framework yields the finding that almost none of the
thirty-six empirical studies refer to social structures as a cause of
populism.\footnote{An important exception is Hameleers et al., ``Start
  Spreading the News.''} In addition to our close reading of the
studies, Ernesto Laclau\textquotesingle s citation offers quantitative
evidence for this major finding. In Bourdieu\textquotesingle s logic,
Laclau is Mudde\textquotesingle s symbolic opponent in the field of
social sciences. For Laclau, populist discourse is the
\emph{consequence} of a discursive gap between political representation
(the signifier) and reality (the signified). He comments on the causes
of populism: ``If I had to subsume them under one label, it would be:
\emph{globalised capitalism}.''\footnote{Ernesto Laclau, \emph{On
  Populist Reason} (London: Verso, 2005), 230.} Mudde and Kaltwasser
consider Laclau\textquotesingle s theory ``extremely
abstract.''\footnote{Cas Mudde and Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, eds.,
  \emph{Populism in Europe and the Americas: Threat or Corrective for
  Democracy?} (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 7.} Mudde
succeeds in narrowing down the slippery concepts of populism by
providing a minimal definition for empirical testing. His focus is on
identifying the measurable \emph{effects} of populist communication as a
threat or counterweight to liberal democracies.\footnote{Mudde, ``The
  Populist Zeitgeist.''} Laclau\textquotesingle s research is situated
on the left in Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s framework,
Mudde\textquotesingle s research is on the right. Mudde is cited 176
times in the field of power; Laclau is cited ten times. If we consider
that Laclau is the best-known populism researcher in the field of social
science,\footnote{Carlos de la Torre, \emph{Routledge Handbook of Global
  Populism} (London: Routledge, 2019).} the field of power has become an
autonomous area of research in the field of communications which
provides a mirror-image inside the field of social science. This
structuralist ordering principle of opposites can hardly be imagined in
a more ideal-typical way in Bourdieu\textquotesingle s field theory. Of
the twenty studies in the heterodox field, Mudde is cited fifteen times;
Laclau is cited forty-seven times. Among the fifteen theorists, Mudde is
cited twenty-four times; Laclau is cited sixteen. This leaves us with an
overall Laclau-Mudde ratio of 215 to 73 in the field of populism
studies. Focusing on the Mudde paradigm also leads

\noindent to a methodological
homogenization. In the pre-field of populism, the ratio between
quantitative and qualitative approaches is in favor of qualitative, with
twenty out of twenty-nine studies. In the more recent field, thirty-two
of the thirty-six empirical studies in the field of power employ a
quantitative research design (89 percent). In the heterodox field, the ratio is
slightly against quantitative designs, with nine out of twenty studies
(45 percent). Theoretical and methodological homogenization has occurred
in the field of power, although there is a greater diversity of authors.
The thirty-eight studies in the field of power are co-authored by 137
authors, averaging 3.6 authors per study. The twenty studies in the
group of heterodox actors are written by thirty-six (co-)authors (an
average of 1.8), and the fifteen theoretical essays are written by
nineteen (co-)authors (an average of 1.3). These differences in the
theories and methodologies employed between the actor groups are shaped
by institutional, especially regional, characteristics.

\hypertarget{regionality-anglophone-world-versus-eu}{%
\subsection{Regionality: Anglophone World
versus
EU}\label{regionality-anglophone-world-versus-eu}}

As we did when addressing the pre-field, we distinguish between the
following regions: the Anglophone world (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, and
New Zealand) and continental Europe, which we call the European Union
(EU) area post Brexit for simplification purposes (Germany, Netherlands,
Austria, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the non-EU country
Switzerland). Overall, there is a rather balanced split of the
seventy-three studies between the regions, with thirty-eight studies
from the EU region and thirty-five studies from the Anglophone world.
However, of the thirty-eight studies from the field of power,
twenty-nine studies are from universities in the EU region, and nine
studies are from the Anglophone world. The imbalance is even greater in
the heterodox actor group; eighteen of the twenty studies are from the
Anglophone world, and two studies are from the EU. Among the theorists,
there are nine articles from the Anglophone world and six from the EU.

Hence, we observe a remarkable effect of the regions regarding the
conceptualization of the causes of populism, which is amplified when we
look more closely at the countries within the actor groups. The three
studies from the field of power that propose a counter frame to the
digitalization hypotheses are from North America.\footnote{Juarez Miro
  and Toff, ``How Right-Wing Populists Engage with Cross-Cutting News on
  Online Message Boards''; Wells et al., ``Trump, Twitter, and News
  Media Responsiveness; Boulianne et al., ``Right-Wing Populism, Social
  Media and Echo Chambers in Western Democracies.''} The two studies
from the heterodox sub-field that argue most strongly in favor of
digitalization and style are from the EU region.\footnote{Tuters and
  Hagen, ``(((They))) Rule: Memetic Antagonism''; Rusche, ``Few Voices,
  Strong Echo.''} Therefore, in contrast to in the Anglophone world, in
Europe there is a danger of an \emph{officialization effect}.\footnote{Bourdieu,
  \emph{Homo Academicus}.} The fact that the same research question is
repeatedly addressed can create the impression that the online world is
fueling right-wing populist attitudes. Through the focus on
digitalization and communication style, the field of power has
experienced a development that Mazzoleni warned against; while it might
be convenient to ``blame the media'' or digitalization for the rise of
populism, ``pursuing this interpretation equates to furnishing an alibi
for phenomena that should really be looked for elsewhere.''\footnote{Mazzoleni,
  ``Populism and the Media,'' 53.} Until now, neoliberalism has not been
addressed as a cause of populism in the field of power. In the
thirty-six empirical studies, the term is mentioned twice in
passing.\footnote{Zulianello et al., ''A Populist \emph{Zeitgeist}?,''
  448; Molek-Kozakowska and Wilk, ``Casual, Colloquial,
  Commonsensical,'' 771.} In addition, criticism of neoliberalism is
described as a characteristic of left-wing populism in the introduction
for the special issue of \emph{New Media \& Society}: ``Radical left
movements initially focused on pre-USSR collapse, criticizing capitalism
and neoliberalism.''\footnote{Homero Gil de Zúñiga et al., ``Populism in
  the Era of Twitter: How Social Media Contextualized New Insights into
  an Old Phenomenon,'' \emph{New Media \& Society} 22, no. 4 (2020):
  587.} Hence, in the field of power, the context of neoliberalism is
not only excluded from empirical analyses, but theoretically placed in
the sphere of deviance.\footnote{Daniel C.~Hallin, \emph{The Uncensored
  War: The Media and Vietnam} (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986).}
The power of the social sciences lies in their monopoly over legitimate
public discourse and legitimate thinking about the social world (see
above). If we neglect the neoliberalism factor, it has implications for
politics, the media, and society.

Assuming that neoliberalism discourse is non-existent in this field in
the EU, it becomes apparent that countries in the Anglophone world
attribute different causes of populism. Hence, we further divide these
studies into two regions: the US and the Commonwealth (UK, Australia,
New Zealand). In the group of heterodox actors, seven studies from the
US focus on societal discontent as a cause of populism, but do not
include criticism of the neoliberal era or globalized capitalism. Nine
studies from the Commonwealth, on the other hand, link the rise of
populism to the effects of neoliberalism or global capitalism. This
means that, unlike in the US and the EU, criticism of neoliberalism is
in the legitimate zone of discourse in the UK, Australia, and New
Zealand. Seven out of a total of thirteen studies from the UK highlight
neoliberalism as a major factor. Therefore, neoliberalism is a
``mainstream'' cause of populism in the UK, and the discourse there
presents a mirror image of the focus of other studies within the field
of populism research.

One interface for heteronomous influence on the field of science is the
funding institutions. In terms of funding, the field of power has a
slightly higher average (0.5), with nineteen out of thirty-eight
studies, than the heterodox group of actors, with eight out of twenty
studies (0.4). This almost equal distribution among the groups of actors
suggests that the regional funding institutions support the regional
understandings of populism in the field. Within the field of power,
however, a difference can be observed regarding the combination of
digitalization and style versus commercialization. Only one study out of
the eight studies in the media complex investigating the
commercialization hypothesis received funding (12.5 percent). Studies in
the political actor complex (nine out of seventeen studies; 53 percent)
and citizen complex (nine out of thirteen studies; 69 percent) with a
focus on the digitalization and style hypothesis received a
significantly higher share of funding. This funding practice may have an
effect on the dynamics of research in the field of populism.

\hypertarget{dynamics-of-the-field-publication-year}{%
\section[\emph{Dynamics of the Field: Publication
Year}]{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Dynamics of the Field: Publication
Year}\footnote{Over time, the limitation that online-first studies are
  also included must be emphasized.}\label{dynamics-of-the-field-publication-year}}

When viewed in the aggregate, the heterodox field is currently in trend,
with a mean publication year of 2000.5, compared to the field of power
(2019.9)---as is ideal in field theory. Theoretical articles are
decreasing at the aggregate level (2019.5). Although the evidence points
increasingly against digitalization and style as drivers of populism, in
the field of power, studies in the political actor complex investigating
\emph{how} populists communicate via social media are in trend, with an
average publication year of 2020.3. But the average publication year is
declining (2019.5) for studies in the citizen complex that test
\emph{whether} populist communication has an effect on attitudes or
democracy---or not. Studies in the media complex focusing on the
commercialization hypothesis occupy a middle position in the field of
power (2019.7). In the heterodox field, the four studies addressing the
digitalization hypothesis have the most recent average publication date
(2021). However, the seven studies that look into social structures as
drivers of populism follow in second place (2000.7). Given the higher
amount of studies, the trend in the field of populism studies could lead
to a battle between the stance of empirical EU researchers, who
forefront digitalization and style, and empirical Anglophone researchers
who focus on social structures. The theorists concentrate on social
structures (2020.6) more than digitalization (2019.4) and
commercialization (2020). The context of neoliberalism has the oldest
average publication date among both theorists (2018) and heterodox
researchers (2019.8) and is in danger of disappearing. However,
Kissas\footnote{Kissas, ``Populist Everyday Politics.''} from the
heterodox group of actors seems to occupy a key position. His study was
published in \emph{New Media \& Society,} a high-impact journal, in
2022. Either Kissas is an isolated case or he is pointing toward a
reversal of the trend. An argument in favor of a trend reversal is that,
in the field of cultural production, authors on the left with low
economic capital yet high scientific capital can rise over time from
being penniless ``bohemians'' to join the ``established avant-garde.''
They can then exert pressure on the field of power through the higher
symbolic capital they have acquired.\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Rules of
  the Art.}} Yet we are still in the present.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In our conclusion, we highlight three key findings of our study, discuss
limitations, and finally point to a framework for future research based
on Bourdieu\textquotesingle s interventions against neoliberalism and
its updated evidence by Thomas Piketty. The main purpose of this study
is to contribute to the question of the most likely causes of the rise
of populism in the liberal democracies of the Western world:
digitalization, the populist style, mediatization, the social structure,
or neoliberalism. Since we analyzed 114 articles from six high-impact
journals in different sub-disciplines of communication studies, we
provide an extract of the best available knowledge on the relationship
between media and populist movements of our time. Having made this
argument from a positivist point of view, we must immediately limit
ourselves; despite the theoretical sampling, we do not cover the entire
pole of power, nor the entire field.

Thus, our first key finding is that in our sample of the six journals
there is little to no evidence that digitalization, populist
communication, or the commercialization of media are the cause or a
significant factor in the rise of populist movements. To sum the
evidence up: the use of online media and social networks may even
decrease support for right-wing populists;\footnote{Boulianne et al.,
  ``Right-Wing Populism, Social Media and Echo Chambers.''} the populist
digital media do not displace the legacy press;\footnote{Stier et al.,
  ``Populist Attitudes and Selective Exposure to Online News''; Müller
  and Bach, ``Populist Alternative News Use and Its Role for
  Elections''; Juarez Miro and Toff, ``How Right-Wing Populists Engage
  with Cross-Cutting News on Online Message Boards.''} and if there are
echo chamber effects in society, they are all political directions and
online not bigger than offline.\footnote{Boulianne et al., ``Right-Wing
  Populism, Social Media and Echo Chambers.''} On digital platforms, the
share of populist messages is lower than in traditional
media,\footnote{Zulianello et al., ``A Populist \emph{Zeitgeist}?'';
  Ernst et al., ``Favorable Opportunity Structures.''} where the overall
share is also low.\textsuperscript{178}
Populist actors gain media attention not through populist style, but
through elements of traditional media logic such as provocations, which
points to commercialization as a cause.\textsuperscript{179} But instead of falling into the trap of commercial
production bias, journalists form a \emph{cordon sanitaire} against
populist actors with their evaluation bias.\textsuperscript{180} The\marginnote{\textsuperscript{178} Müller et al., ``The Polarizing Impact of

the media life cycle model shows that the media are not the driver of a
possible populist zeitgeist, but that they follow it.\footnote{Müller et
  al., ``The Polarizing Impact of News Coverage on Populist Attitudes in
  the Public''; Nygaard, ``Boundary Work''; Wirz et al., ``The Effects
  of Right-Wing Populist Communication on Emotions and Cognitions toward
  Immigrants.''} While the effects of populist messages are always small
and require interpretation to weigh them,\footnote{Hameleers et al.,
  ``Selective Exposure to Populist Communication''; Müller et al., ``The
  Polarizing Impact of News Coverage on Populist Attitudes in the
  Public; Egelhofer et al., ``Populist Attitudes and Politicians'
  Disinformation Accusations.''} the results for the link between
populist attitudes and social determinants such as income, education,
age, and gender are clear.\footnote{Müller et al., ``The Polarizing
  Impact of News Coverage on Populist Attitudes in the Public''; Fawzi,
  ``Untrustworthy News and the Media as `Enemy of the People?'\,'';
  Stier et al., ``Populist Attitudes and Selective Exposure to Online
  News''; Müller and Bach, ``Populist Alternative News Use and Its Role
  for Elections.''} Furthermore, the study that examines social
structure in the most depth, the sixteen-country experiment by Hameleers
with twenty-eight co-authors,\footnote{Hameleers et al., ``Start
  Spreading the News.''} shows that the motivational potential of
populist messages increases with the national unemployment rate and the
overall political climate, but not with a country\textquotesingle s
level of immigration. This result is consistent with the robust finding
that it is not the right-wing anti-outgroup component that is crucial
for the rise of populist movements but the anti-elite component, which
includes left and right-wing populism.\footnote{Bobba et al., ``Populism
  and the Gender Gap''; Blassnig et al., ``Populism in Online Election
  Coverage''; Fawzi, ``Untrustworthy News and the Media as `Enemy of the
  People?'\,''} Taken together, these findings point to economic changes
in the social structure as the main driver of populism with a general
distrust of ``elites'' and open up the possibility that neoliberalism is
a significant cause.

However, and this is our second key finding, this evidence is not
reflected in the impact of articles that consecrate our investigated
journals, where studies that mention social structure or neoliberalism
as the root of populism receive lower impact than studies pursuing the
power field's illusio. Thus, instead of supporting the belief that a
higher impact reflects the best available knowledge, our study rather
points to the relevance of Bourdieu\textquotesingle s social
constructivist distinction between symbolic and scientific capital. The
focus on digitalization and style to explain the emergence of populism
is not based on the field autonomous scientific capital, but rather
follows a heteronomous logic to increase symbolic capital. The tendency
to over-interpret the role of the media in the power pole may lie in the
habitual striving to gain social relevance through knowledge production
for the outside world\footnote{Meyen, ``International Communication
  Association Fellows.''} or in the historical closeness to the
heteronomous-worldly pole,\footnote{Park, ``Pierre Bourdieu und die
  Geschichte des Feldes der Kommunikationswissenschaft.''} and becomes
visible in the funding practice, where the focus on the digitalization
and style hypothesis receives the highest share.

What might appear disrespectful in Bourdieu\textquotesingle s conception
(what academic would want to position themself at a distance from the
autonomous intellectual pole?) is at the same time a strength. In times
of hate speech, conspiracy theories, online radicalization, and events
such as the storming of the US Capitol, it would be fatal if
communication studies did not investigate whether social media and
populist styles are the cause of the rise of right-wing populist
attitudes. In comparison to the heterodox actor\textquotesingle s group
and theorists, the great advantage of the field of power is that it has
narrowed down the various conceptions of populism to a minimal
definition, which has yielded an impressive body of empirical evidence.
Based on this evidence, right-wing populism can be explained in an
exaggerated way: Media populism and digital style are dead. This insight
from the empirical results should be communicated to the outside world
and prevail in the impact consecrated through the journals. Instead, the
dynamics in the field of populism studies indicate that digitalization
and style hypotheses continue to be the trend and that even in the
heterodox group the neoliberalism factor is disappearing from the
analysis. Thus, in addition to providing theoretical and empirical
insights, this study is also an appeal to the patrons of major journals
to promote critical perspectives. Aware of such endeavors in journals
like the \emph{Journal of Communication},\footnote{Christian Fuchs and
  Jack L. Qiu, ``Ferments in the Field: Introductory Reflections on the
  Past, Present and Future of Communication Studies,'' \emph{Journal of
  Communication} 68 (2018).} our appeal is more specifically to European
patrons of populism research, which leads to our third key finding.

We observe a remarkable regional difference in the conceptualization of
the causes of populism, with the distinction between Anglophone scholars
and scholars from the EU region revealing even greater differences than
the distinction between the field of power and the heteronomous group.
In its socio-geographical genesis, the field of populism studies is a
mirror image of the entire field of communication studies.\footnote{Löblich
  and Scheu, ``Writing the History of Communication Studies.''} In the
field of populism, it has mostly been European scholars who have
displaced critical Anglophone scholarship, not vice versa.

While Mazzoleni\textquotesingle s intention with his influential article
on media populism was to use the concept of mediatization to bridge a
systemic approach with actor-centered populist strategies, the later
reduction of the term media populism to Mudde\textquotesingle s
ideology-centered understanding of populism\footnote{de Vreese et al.,
  ``Populism as an Expression of Political Communication Content and
  Style.''} again excluded contextual factors. The result of this
theoretical and methodological homogenization in the European shaped
field of power is as follows: While studies from the Anglophone world
still problematize social structure or neoliberalism as causes of
populism and/or set up a counter frame to the digitalization or style
hypotheses, there is a complete void in empirical studies in the EU
region when it comes to addressing socio-structural factors as causes.
Having shown that 89 percent of the studies on digitalization and style
hypotheses have been funded makes the heteronomous influence on the
field of populism studies in the EU region evident. Bearing in mind
Bourdieu's critiques against the commodification of public goods such as
education in the l990s and 2000s by the European Union and their
``anti-democratic institutions'' which are ``increasingly subjected to
the dictates of international bodies whose aim is to strip the entire
world of all obstacles to the exercise of an increasingly concentrated
economic power,''\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Firing Back}, 71.} we call
for an investigation of funding practices in the EU region on a larger
scale. Future research will be needed to test whether there is a
systematic bias in neglecting the self-initiated changes in the social
structure as causes for the ``crisis of democracy''\footnote{Wolfgang
  Streeck, \emph{Critical Encounters: Capitalism, Democracy, Idea}
  (London: Verso, 2020).} and over-promoting less relevant factors such
as the onset of social media, disinformation, or hate speech. Our final
task follows a recent call to bring Bourdieu and his critique of
neoliberalism into the field of populism studies.\footnote{Krämer, ``How
  German Communication Research Discovered Bourdieu.''}

Bourdieu defined neoliberalism ``as a program for destroying collective
structures in a planned manner with the objective of paving the way for
the free market's neoliberal utopia.''\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Firing
  Back}, 68.} The ``scientifically predictable consequences'' of
neoliberal policies, he said, are a longing for the nation-state,
xenophobia, chiliastic reveries, and ``hordes of people who follow the
first demagogue they come across.''\footnote{Bourdieu, 71.} The latter
are ``cynical kitsch characters'' who appear to have political power,
but actually only serve media mechanisms and embody the depoliticization
of disappointed people. Readers can, if they wish, derive a
characterization of the personified research problem of populism studies
from this prognosis. See above.

In the late 1990s, Bourdieu explained why it is so difficult to gather
evidence for a critique of neoliberalism: Its mechanisms are subtle, and
its consequences will only become visible twenty years later.\footnote{Bourdieu,
  88.} Today, we confirm the rise of populist movements in Western
liberal democracies, and the economist Piketty provides an updated
version of Bourdieu\textquotesingle s argument to explain populist
movements. There are semantic differences between the two French
scholars. Instead of referring to neoliberalism, Piketty speaks of
hyper-capitalism or of what Bourdieu calls symbolic power, which is
similar to Piketty\textquotesingle s conception of ideology. Piketty
shows the consequences of the ``conservative revolution'' of the 1980s
with the shift to the ``neo-proprietarian ideology'': inequality has
increased in all regions of the world, especially in the US, where the
top decile\textquotesingle s share of national income was higher in 2020
than it was in 1900.\footnote{Thomas Piketty, \emph{Capital and
  Ideology}, 37.} Since neoliberal measures were essentially driven by
pro-worker parties, Piketty observes ``legitimate feelings of
abandonment''\footnote{Piketty, 33.} in populist movements and sheds
light on a disorder in the politic-ideological sphere in Western
democracies. Due to the academization of the traditional left parties,
political conflict no longer takes place between top and bottom, but
between the intellectual and cultural elite versus the commercial and
financial elite. Piketty defines the term populism as ``a catch-all term
frequently used by elites to discredit political movements they deem to
be insufficiently under their control,'' and states: ``If one wants to
explain the rise of `populism,' it might not be a bad idea to begin by
looking at the rise of `elitist' political parties.''\footnote{Piketty,
  33.}

Using Bourdieu\textquotesingle s notion of ``homology''---that is, the
organization of parallel social spaces around the same basic divisions
between economic and cultural capital\footnote{Bourdieu,
  \emph{Distinction.}}---we can apply Piketty\textquotesingle s analysis
to journalism. A first step would be a ``field mapping''\footnote{Rodney
  Benson, ``News Media as a `Journalistic Field' What Bourdieu Adds to
  New Institutionalism, and Vice Versa,'' \emph{Political Communication}
  23, no. 2 (2006).} by examining the demographic characteristics of
audiences of the journalistic products to see if the shifting cleavages
in the party structure are reflected in the field of journalism. In
Bourdieu\textquotesingle s conception, the power of the media is both
great and small. It is small because of the heteronomy of the
journalistic field, in which journalists follow the external constraints
of the economic and political fields, becoming ``puppets of a coercive
context.''\footnote{Bourdieu, \emph{Firing Back}, 67.} The power of the
media is great because of its promise of symbolic power and, in the case
of neoliberalism, the incessant hammering of ``economic vulgarities''
until they become collective beliefs without alternatives. The second
step would be to identify, in a more nuanced way than Bourdieu, which
media propagate the myths of hyper-capitalism\footnote{Piketty,
  \emph{Capital and Ideology}.} and whether they reflect the economic
interests of their audiences. Following Piketty\textquotesingle s ideal
of a bottom versus top cleavage in the polit-ideological sphere,
low-symbolic media should oppose neoliberal policies such as tax and
welfare cuts, and high-symbolic media will favor them. In addition,
since position holders close to the cultural pole rely more on state
support, we expect media with higher cultural capital to be more likely
to oppose neoliberal reforms, and conversely, media with a higher ratio
of economic to cultural capital to favor free market policies. If this
state of the media structure is not given, the results could indicate a
homologous explanation for distrust in media, just as Piketty argues for
distrust in the political field, where the lack of representation leads
to an anger against the elites, which is called populism. This is one
direction to investigate the relationship between media, populism, and
neoliberalism. One could provide many more---for example, through the
studies on ``market populism'' from the pre-field of Western populism
studies.\footnote{Greenfield and Williams, ``Financialization, Finance
  Rationality and the Role of Media in Australia.''}

We limited our field analysis to the context of the Western world due to
the research problem of rising populism in liberal democracies. Of the
thirteen studies in the field which examine populism in the non-Western
world, four studies apply the field's dominant definition of populism
based on Mudde,\footnote{Ricardo F. Mendonça and Renato Duarte Caetano,
  ``Populism as Parody: The Visual Self-Presentation of Jair Bolsonaro
  on Instagram,'' \emph{The International Journal of Press/Politics} 26,
  no. 1 (2021); Ignacio Siles et al., ``Populism, Religion, and Social
  Media in Central America,'' \emph{The International Journal of
  Press/Politics}, Online First (2021); Jefferson Lyndon D. Ragragio,
  ``Mediatized Voices of Science: News Media Narratives} while nine studies
use the term populism in manifold forms.\textsuperscript{206} Thus, the Central European concepts of
populism have traveled around the world, albeit on a small scale, but
the non-Western concepts of populism have not yet penetrated the
research context of the Western democracies. A systematic global
comparison of the meanings and equivalents of populism around the world
is pending. In the debate about the ``De-Westernization'' of

  Wiedemann and Michael Meyen, ``Internationalization through
  Americanization: The Expansion of the International Communication
  Association's Leadership to the World,'' \emph{International Journal
  of Communication} 10 (2016).} this study has shown that research of
the Anglophone world should not be equated with the quantitative
socio-scientific paradigm of small media effects. Moreover, the internal
differences in the Western fields also need to be highlighted in the
history of media studies---for example, through field reflections that
go beyond the power pole rather than, as in our limited study, focusing
only on the elite journals.

The sharp conceptual differences between Anglophone and EU research on
populism reflect a fragmented internationalization in communication
studies; even though researchers from the Western world publish in the
same journals and meet physically at conferences like the ICA,
intellectual exchange between the two sides of the Atlantic remains low.
It is also noteworthy that, with Bourdieu and Piketty, we are pioneers
in introducing a French perspective on the emergence of populism into
international communication scholarship, since there is no study from a
French university in the field of populism studies. Thus, this field
analysis is an empirical confirmation that the communities of two
fundamental countries of the European Union, France and Germany, are
largely unfamiliar with the writings on the other side of the
Rhine.\footnote{Stefanie Averbeck-Lietz et al., ``Understanding and
  Stimulating the (Still) Neglected German-French Milieu in
  Communication and Media Studies,'' \emph{History of Media Studies} 3
  (2023).}
