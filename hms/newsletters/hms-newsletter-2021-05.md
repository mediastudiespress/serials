1. *CFP: Science Popularization as Cultural Diplomacy: UNESCO (1946-1958)* 
	* From its creation after World War II, UNESCO became a political battleground in which different visions of science and the world order fought for hegemony. As it is well known, Julian Huxley (1887-1975) and Joseph Needham (1900-1995) were the first General Director and the first Director of the Natural Sciences Division. Their administration stressed the "social implications of science" -through the influence of Bernalist Marxism- and the "periphery principle" in international relations. The goal of the workshop is to explore the history of international science popularization policies and practices at UNESCO as tools for governance and cultural diplomacy from the Huxley-Needham administration to the end of Auger's leadership in 1958.
	* **Deadline:** 15 June 2021
	* [More details](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A2=ind2104&L=MERSENNE&O=D&P=74796)
1. *Public conversation: Paul Gilroy and Ruth Wilson Gilmore  on *Stuart Hall: Selected Writings on Race and Difference** 
	* In this Theory from the Margins event, we discuss Selected Writings on Race and Difference, edited by Paul Gilroy and Ruth Wilson Gilmore. In *Selected Writings on Race and Difference*, editors Paul Gilroy and Ruth Wilson Gilmore gather more than twenty essays by Stuart Hall that highlight his extensive and groundbreaking engagement with race, representation, identity, difference, and diaspora.
	* **Deadline:** 13 May 2021
	* [More details](https://theoryfromthemargins.com/events.html)
1. *Call for Submissions: FHHS Early Career Award & Article Prize* 
	* The Forum for History of Human Science (FHHS) and the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Science (JHBS) encourage researchers in their early careers to submit unpublished manuscripts for the annual John C. Burnham Early Career Award, named in honor of this prominent historian of the human sciences and past-editor of JHBS. The publisher provides the author of the paper an honorarium of US $500 at the time the manuscript is accepted for publication by JHBS. The Forum for History of Human Science awards a biennial prize (a nonmonetary honor) for the best article published recently on some aspect of the history of the human sciences. The article prize is awarded in odd-numbered years. 
	* **Deadline:** 1 June 2021
	* [More details](http://fhhs.org/awards/)
1. *Registration Still Open: ICA Pre-conference on the Exclusions in the History and Historiography of Communication Studies* 
	* The broader field of communication studies is in a moment when we are--or should be--intensively interrogating patterns of exclusion and hegemony that have continued to constitute it: around global region (de-Westernizing, theory from the South, persistent patterns of Americanization), race (#communicationsowhite), gender (Matilda effects), and indigeneity/colonization (postcolonial and decolonial initiatives). It is time to animate our histories of communication and media studies with similar problematics, recognizing the patterns and performances through which the field(s) has organized itself around constitutive exclusions and continues actively to do so in epistemological and social practices of historiography. See the tentative [preconference schedule](https://hms.mediastudies.press/pub/schedule/release/4). [Registration](https://www.icahdq.org/event/PC-History) ($40/students free) will help cover the costs of simultaneous English-Spanish translation.
	* 26 & 27 May 2021 (remote)
	* [More details](https://www.icahdq.org/event/PC-History)
