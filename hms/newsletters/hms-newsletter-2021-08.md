	1. *CHSTM Research Fellowships Available* 
		* The Consortium for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine invites applications for research fellowships in the history of science, technology and medicine, broadly construed. These fellowships are open to scholars at all stages of their academic careers, and will support research travel to Consortium member institutions as research activities can resume. Research Fellows will be awarded a stipend of $750 for use of each collection, $425 if the collection is less than 100 miles from another collection for which a stipend has already been awarded. Candidates who live 100 or more miles from the collections they will use will receive some preference.

	1. *CFP: Knowledge on the Move: Information Networks During and After the Holocaust* 
		* The movement, production, and circulation of knowledge, ideas, and information through networks of marginalized groups and across borders and boundaries have increasingly become the focus of historical research in recent decades. At the same time, scholars have worked to integrate the perspectives of Jews and other groups victimized by the Nazi regime within Holocaust Studies in order to highlight their diverse forms of agency. For instance, the study of resistance networks, subversive knowledge exchange, and transnational commemorative efforts has fostered an understanding of the Holocaust that is grounded in broader local, regional, national, transnational, and at times overlapping contexts. “Knowledge on the Move” aims to bring together scholars who are reconsidering the Holocaust and its aftermath through the lenses of Jewish and non-Jewish information networks, broadly conceived. In a two-day workshop, scholars will present and comment on individual pre-circulated papers. This workshop aims to prompt innovative research questions regarding the information production and knowledge circulation in Europe and beyond during and after the Nazi genocide.
		* **Deadline:** 15 September 2021

1. *Online Workshop: History of Historical Science Studies in the Long 20th Century* 
	* The historical science studies gained their modern form during the long twentieth century. The aim of this workshop is to explore the history of this field of study. The term "modern historical science studies" should be understood as a heuristic concept, which indicates a difference from more traditional forms of history of science. The reason behind the choice of this concept is that modern historical science studies are characterized by an interdisciplinary approach to the historical objects of the sciences, whereas more traditional history of science was mainly written as an experience-based reflection by representatives of the respective scientific disciplines themselves. The contributions to the workshop focus on practices, the circulation processes of concepts, and individual representatives of different approaches to the history of science. Furthermore, a purely ‘western’ focus will be avoided, and the historical science studies in Eastern Europe will be equally taken into account. The workshop will be conducted as a Zoom meeting. The languages are English and German. 
	* **Deadline:** 28 August 2021
