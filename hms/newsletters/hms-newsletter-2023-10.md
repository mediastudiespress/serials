<br>

1. *CFP: Repressed Histories of Communication and Media Studies* 
	* This year’s pre-conference focuses on “Repressed Histories” in the fields of media, information, and communication studies. We invite proposals that address our focus on “repressed histories” in and of the field by taking seriously and engaging directly with research, theories, sites, and thinkers whose contributions have been sidestepped, marginalized, occluded, or have simply not received the attention they deserve because of their geographical location, the historical traditions their belong to, as well as the combined effects of publishing circuits, border control, linguistic barriers, and knowledge traditions that continue to shape our field.
	* **Deadline:** 30 January 2024
	* [More details](https://www.icahdq.org/mpage/ICA24-repressed)
1. *Workshop: Epistemic transfer* 
	* The workshop on Epistemic Transfer in the History of the Humanities is sponsored by the Society for the History of the Humanities. The purpose of this workshop is to grasp the phenomenon of knowledge transfer in a systematic way, in order to answer general questions such as: Why and how do humanities disciplines borrow knowledge from one another? Under what conditions has knowledge transfer been (un)successful in the past? And what light, if at all, do historical examples shed on current forms of (inter)disciplinarity? The event will take place digitally on 14-15 November 2023 and will be free of charge. The program includes both senior and younger career scholars. Full program to be published soon.

1. *History of the Human Sciences, Early Career Prize, 2023-24* 
	* *History of the Human Sciences* – the international journal of peer-reviewed research, which provides the leading forum for work in the social sciences, humanities, human psychology and biology that reflexively examines its own historical origins and interdisciplinary influences – is delighted to announce details of its annual prize for early career scholars. The intention of the annual award is to recognise a researcher whose work best represents the journal’s aim to critically examine traditional assumptions and preoccupations about human beings, their societies and their histories in light of developments that cut across disciplinary boundaries. In the pursuit of these goals, *History of the Human Sciences* publishes traditional humanistic studies as well work in the social sciences, including the fields of sociology, psychology, political science, the history and philosophy of science, anthropology, classical studies, and literary theory. Scholars working in any of these fields are encouraged to apply.
	* **Deadline:** 26 January 2024
