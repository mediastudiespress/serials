1. *CFP: Workshop on the Sociology and History of the Social and Human Sciences* 
	* The series of annual workshops on the sociology and history of the social and human sciences (SHSHS) at the University of Graz, Austria, intends to create a space where these different approaches and interests can meet and enter into dialogue with each other. By providing an open forum of exchange for early-career researchers (Master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral students) the workshops aim at building an interdisciplinary and international community of people interested in socio-historical studies of the social and human sciences. We invite contributions from and/or on the whole array of the social and human sciences: sociology, history, psychology, cultural and social anthropology, political science, economics, statistics, demography, philosophy, linguistics, literary studies, philologies, art history, cultural studies, science studies, history and sociology of science, etc.
	* **Deadline:** 31 August 2023

1. *Workshop: Epistemic transfer* 
	* The workshop on Epistemic Transfer in the History of the Humanities is sponsored by the Society for the History of the Humanities. The purpose of this workshop is to grasp the phenomenon of knowledge transfer in a systematic way, in order to answer general questions such as: Why and how do humanities disciplines borrow knowledge from one another? Under what conditions has knowledge transfer been (un)successful in the past? And what light, if at all, do historical examples shed on current forms of (inter)disciplinarity? The event will take place digitally on 14-15 November 2023 and will be free of charge. The program includes both senior and younger career scholars. Full program to be published soon.

1. *Call for Submissions: *History of Social Science** 
	* We are pleased to announce the launch of a new journal, [*History of Social Science*](https://hss.pennpress.org/home/), published by the University of Pennsylvania Press on behalf of the [Society for the History of Recent Social Science](https://hisress.org/) (HISRESS). _History of Social Science_ offers an international forum for the examination of the transformations of the social sciences since the early twentieth century. An important editorial commitment of the journal is to solicit and cultivate scholarship on the history of the social sciences throughout the world, as well as work that traces the transnational circulation and mutual shaping of ideas, practices, and personnel. The journal is now [accepting submissions](https://hss.scholasticahq.com/for-authors).

1. *Working Group on the History of the Language Sciences* 
	* The history of the language sciences has expanded considerably in recent years, moving to consider broader disciplinary constellations, global developments, extra-intellectual dynamics, and non-elite actors. This new group, hosted by the Consortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicine (CHSTM) builds upon that energy, seeking to underscore the centrality of linguistic knowledge to the history and historiography of science. It provides a forum where those with interests in all varieties of linguistic research can come together to share work in progress, engage in “slow reading,” and build community through discussion.
