1. *ESHHS Early Career Award* 
	* The European Society for the History of the Human Sciences, together with the *Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences*  (*JHBS*) encourages early career researchers to submit their papers for the Early Career Award. The winning paper can be submitted to *JHBS*. If  accepted after additional review, it will be published with a notice indicating that it is the winner of the ESHHS Early Career Award. The Publisher will then provide an honorarium of US $500 to the award recipient. All students are eligible to be considered for the Award, as are all researchers having completed their PhD no more than 5 years previous to the date of submission.
	* **Deadline:** 15 November 2022
	* [More details](https://www.eshhs.eu/wordpress-3.3.1/wordpress/?page_id=14)
1. *CFP: ICA Preconference on the Legacies of Elihu Katz* 
	* Elihu Katz (1926–2021) was a peerless scholar, colleague, mentor, administrator, and friend to many in the field of communication. His passing has left the field with an absence that calls out for remembrance and for scholarly consideration. This one-day, all-plenary preconference will create a space for scholarly exchange on Katz’s life, works, and themes—a forum, in other words, for active, critical engagement with his legacy for the field. The preconference invites presenters to explore, critique, and extend Katz’s contributions to communication scholarship. Some will situate Katz’s legacies in pertinent historical contexts; others will use his work to imagine media futures; still others will consider Katz’s many roles (teacher, institution-builder, broadcast pioneer, mentor).
	* **Deadline:** 20 December 2022
	* [More details](https://buttondown.email/communicationhistory/archive/ica-2023-preconference-on-the-legacies-of-elihu/)
1. *Call for Papers: Special Issue of Human Communication Research* 
	* *Human Communication Research* (*HCR*) historically has been, and remains today, an important outlet for projects that develop, advance, and critique communication theory using social science methods (broadly defined). The purpose of this special issue is to highlight and celebrate that key part of *HCR*'s mission (i.e., innovative theory development) on its 50th birthday both by taking stock and looking forward. Authors are invited to submit proposals for papers that advance our theoretical understanding of communication. Rather than provide literature reviews, these proposals should focus on theory development that will offer a roadmap for scholars to enhance our understanding of communication in ways that are both cognizant of our changing communication landscapes and that are inclusive with regard to issues relevant to our global and diverse societies. 
	* **Deadline:** 15 November 2022
	* [More details](https://academic.oup.com/hcr/pages/cfp-50th-anniversary)
1. *CFP: Eighth Annual Conference on the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS)* 
	* This two-day conference of the Society for the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS), at Uppsala University in Sweden, will bring together researchers working on the history of post-World War II social science. It will provide a forum for the latest research on the cross-disciplinary history of the post-war social sciences, including but not limited to anthropology, economics, psychology, political science, and sociology as well as related fields like area studies, communication studies, history, international relations, law, and linguistics. The conference aims to build upon the recent emergence of work and conversation on cross-disciplinary themes in the postwar history of the social sciences.
	* **Deadline:** 3 February 2023
	* [More details](https://hisress.org/cfp/)
1. *CFP: Society for U.S. Intellectual Hitory* 
	* The 2023 Society for U.S. Intellectual History annual conference will be held in Denver, Colorado, November 9-11, 2023. The site for the conference is the Curtis Hotel right in the heart of downtown. The conference theme is “Utopia/Dystopia: Intellectual Landscapes of Dreams and Disasters.” We invite submissions that respond to the conference theme or that deal with any other aspect of U.S. intellectual history or the teaching of U.S. intellectual history.
	* **Deadline:** 15 April, 2023
	* [More details](https://s-usih.org/2022/11/2023-s-usih-call-for-proposals/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=2023-s-usih-call-for-proposals)
1. *CFP: The 24th International Conference on the History of Concepts.* 
	* The 24rd International Conference on the History of Concepts brings together scholars from all disciplines interested in conceptual history. It offers a platform for interdisciplinary exchange on the problems and practice of the history of concepts and fosters the international network of conceptual historians. Although the conference gathers a broad community of conceptual historians regardless of their topic and region of interest, this year we would like to encourage reflecting on concepts in a localized and/or spatialized manner. The point of departure is for us the very locality where the conference takes place, Eastern Europe. However, its spatialized condition has a much broader, global, and perhaps universal reach, characterizing various tensions and differentials of the global space of conceptual transfers and their impact on historical processes. 
	* **Deadline:** 30 March 2023
