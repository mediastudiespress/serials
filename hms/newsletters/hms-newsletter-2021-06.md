1. *CFP: Science Popularization as Cultural Diplomacy: UNESCO (1946-1958)* 
	* From its creation after World War II, UNESCO became a political battleground in which different visions of science and the world order fought for hegemony. As it is well known, Julian Huxley (1887-1975) and Joseph Needham (1900-1995) were the first General Director and the first Director of the Natural Sciences Division. Their administration stressed the "social implications of science" -through the influence of Bernalist Marxism- and the "periphery principle" in international relations. The goal of the workshop is to explore the history of international science popularization policies and practices at UNESCO as tools for governance and cultural diplomacy from the Huxley-Needham administration to the end of Auger's leadership in 1958.
	* **Deadline:** 15 June 2021

1. *Making the Social World Objective. Theoretical, Practical, and Visual Forms of Social and Economic Knowledge, 1850-2000, 10-11 November 2021* 
	* From the 1850s onwards, “the social” gradually came to prominence as an object of study in industrializing and industrialized countries. More particularly, images played a more and more important role in the ways in which general representations of the economic and social world were devised and in guiding how it was understood. The main tool for an objective approach to “the social” that was available to experts, to those involved in government administration and politics, and to subordinated or marginalized groups, was to represent it in words, numbers, or images. This conference proposes to return to these manifold strategies and methods for objectifying and visualizing the social that were developed from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards. 
	* **Deadline:** 15 June 2021
