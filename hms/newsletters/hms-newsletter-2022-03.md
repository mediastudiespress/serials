## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

*If you have a call or announcement relevant to the history of media studies, please [contact us](mailto:hms@mediastudies.press).*

***

1. *Call for Papers and Panels ‘The Making of the Humanities X’, Pittsburgh* 
	* We are delighted to announce that Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) together with the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) will organize the 10th Making of the Humanities conference, from 3 till 5 November 2022. The MoH conferences are organized by the Society for the History of the Humanities and bring together scholars and historians interested in the history of a wide variety of fields, including archaeology, art history, historiography, linguistics, literary studies, media studies, musicology, and philology, tracing these fields from their earliest developments to the modern day. We welcome panels and papers on any period or region. We are especially interested in work that transcends the history of specific humanities disciplines by comparing scholarly practices across disciplines and civilisations.
	* **Deadline:** 15 May 2022
	* [More details](http://www.historyofhumanities.org/2022/01/28/call-for-papers-and-panels-the-making-of-the-humanities-x-pittsburgh/)
1. *CFP – 7th International Workshop on Historical Epistemology: Arts and Sciences, Historicizing Boundaries (Venice, 9-10 June 2022)* 
	* The 7th International Workshop on Historical Epistemology is dedicated to exploring new ways of approaching the historical, conceptual, methodological, and technical relations between the arts and the sciences. Rather than looking for logical criteria for demarcating these domains, the workshop aims to question the arts/sciences dyad from the vantage point of its history. What can historical epistemology teach us about the boundary lines or relationship between the arts and the sciences? What might a historicized approach to the epistemological question of the different ways of accessing reality, of capturing or intervening in the world, add to our discussion? Can the distinction between scientific discovery and artistic creation be tackled from the point of view of historical epistemology? At the methodological level, can the history of the sciences fruitfully mesh with art history? Can art historians, historians of science, philosophers and cultural historians learn from each other’s methods?
	* **Deadline:** 15 March, 2022
	* [More details](https://episthist.hypotheses.org/2958)
1. *CFP Special Journal Issue: “A Decade in Games Studies"* 
	* With its 10th issue, *GAME* (www.gamejournal.it) aims to attend to the changes, turns and critical rifts and folds that have taken place during the past decade in the study of games and play. We invite contributions to critically explore, examine, and even challenge and overturn research directions, trends, and both open-ended or arguably dead-end pathways undertaken by scholarship in digital games in any field and across interdisciplinary approaches and methodologies. For this issue, we welcome contributions that chart these and other crucial turns and moments occurred in game studies across these past ten years, with an aim to historicise and map out possible gaps and interstitial spaces of knowledge, while pointing towards urgent and pressing questions.
	* **Deadline:** 28 March 2022
	* [More details](https://www.gamejournal.it/n-10-2021-22-a-decade-in-games-studies/)
1. *Call for Submissions: 2022 Dorothy Ross Prize* 
	* The Society for U.S. Intellectual History (S-USIH) is now accepting nominations for the 2022 Dorothy Ross Prize for best article in US intellectual history by an emerging scholar (defined as a current graduate student or a scholar within 5 years of receiving the PhD).

	* The European Society for the History of the Human Sciences (ESHHS) invites submissions to its 41st conference to be held from August 30 to September 2, 2022. The conference is hosted by the Sigmund Freud Private University Berlin, which is located at the former airport building Berlin Tempelhof, and will be held in person.

1. *CFP: 50th Anniversary Tribute to Dallas Smythe in China* 
	* The aim of this special issue of the *Chinese Journal of Communication* (*CJC*) is to bring forth Dallas Smythe’s intellectual legacy so as to link critical inquiry of the unfolding contestations with social struggles of the 20th century. While critical scholars often evoke Smythe’s concept of audience commodity and his treatment of “work” when examining immaterial labour and the new modes of exploitation in digital capitalism, Smythe has much more to offer. His critique of the “dependency road” and his consistent support for national sovereignties to extend democratic participation in development and governance, exemplifies the kind of critical praxis aimed at contesting global power structures. After all, one should remember that Smythe blazed a path of challenging Cold War-enforced sinological orientalism and engaging China’s self-proclaimed socialist theories and practices of development.
	* **Deadline:** 31 August 2022
