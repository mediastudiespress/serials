1. *CFP: ICA Preconference on the Legacies of Elihu Katz* 
	* Elihu Katz (1926–2021) was a peerless scholar, colleague, mentor, administrator, and friend to many in the field of communication. His passing has left the field with an absence that calls out for remembrance and for scholarly consideration. This one-day, all-plenary preconference will create a space for scholarly exchange on Katz’s life, works, and themes—a forum, in other words, for active, critical engagement with his legacy for the field. The preconference invites presenters to explore, critique, and extend Katz’s contributions to communication scholarship. Some will situate Katz’s legacies in pertinent historical contexts; others will use his work to imagine media futures; still others will consider Katz’s many roles (teacher, institution-builder, broadcast pioneer, mentor).
	* **Deadline:** 20 December 2022
	* [More details](https://buttondown.email/communicationhistory/archive/ica-2023-preconference-on-the-legacies-of-elihu/)
1. *CFP: Critical Sociology of Media and Communication: Theoretical Contributions to a Disconnected Field* 
	* This special issue of *Critical Sociology* seeks papers exploring the critical sociology of media and communication. Contributions examining epistemological, ontological and axiological/praxiological dimensions are particularly welcome. We invite sociologists, media and communication scholars, critical theorists, interdisciplinary, and other scholars to address one or more of the following or related questions. How do approaches and thinkers inspired by Marx enrich the field of sociology of media and communication? What is the historical role of the critical study of media and communication within the discipline of sociology? How has it changed over time? Does the critical sociology of media and communication differ from other critical approaches such as critical theory and political economy? 
	* **Deadline:** 31 October 2022
	* [More details](https://www.isa-sociology.org/uploads/imgen/1345-cfp-critical-sociology-of-media-and-communication-esa-rn18-2022.pdf?1662457592)
1. *Conference Program of the Making of the Humanities X Is Now Available* 
	* We are delighted to announce that the FULL PROGRAM with the book of abstracts of The Making of the Humanities X conference is available and can be [downloaded here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tnnsc8hycwie5s6/Program%20booklet%20MoH%20X%2010102022.pdf?dl=0).

Participation to the conference is free, but all presenters must be a member of the Society for the History of the Humanities. The Society promotes the study of the history of humanistic disciplines including, but not limited to, archaeology, art history, historiography, linguistics, literary studies, musicology, philology, and media studies.

1. *CFP: Expressions of Interest - Cultural Studies: A Global History* 
	* *Cultural Studies: A Global History*: This project aims to provide the first global history of cultural studies as a field, with a particular focus on its institutional manifestations and the ways in which cultural studies has been taken up in different cultural and geographical settings to various ends. We are seeking expressions of interest from potential collaborators with expertise in specific regional or national contexts, including but not limited to those listed above. We are looking for people who would be willing to develop a regionally specific history of cultural studies in a particular location over the course of an extended research period. We anticipate that this project will develop as a genuinely collaborative undertaking, in which different participants’ research expertise in local contexts will help to develop the research questions that we will collectively pursue. We welcome people with a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds, but a lively interest in the history and present of cultural studies.
	* **Deadline:** 21 October 2022
	* [More details](https://networks.h-net.org/node/23910/discussions/10797051/cfp-expressions-interest-cultural-studies-global-history)
1. *Call for Papers: Special Issue of Human Communication Research* 
	* *Human Communication Research* (*HCR*) historically has been, and remains today, an important outlet for projects that develop, advance, and critique communication theory using social science methods (broadly defined). The purpose of this special issue is to highlight and celebrate that key part of *HCR*'s mission (i.e., innovative theory development) on its 50th birthday both by taking stock and looking forward. Authors are invited to submit proposals for papers that advance our theoretical understanding of communication. Rather than provide literature reviews, these proposals should focus on theory development that will offer a roadmap for scholars to enhance our understanding of communication in ways that are both cognizant of our changing communication landscapes and that are inclusive with regard to issues relevant to our global and diverse societies. 
	* **Deadline:** 15 November 2022
	* [More details](https://academic.oup.com/hcr/pages/cfp-50th-anniversary)
1. *Call for Submissions: 2022 Cheiron Book Prize*

Eligible works for the 2022 Cheiron Book Prize include original book-length historical studies, written in English and published in 2020 or 2021. Topical areas can include, but are not limited to, histories of psychology, psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, and social statistics.

	* **Deadline:** 15 October 2022
	* [More details](https://cheironsoc.org/call-for-submissions/)
1. *CFP: Eighth Annual Conference on the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS)* 
	* This two-day conference of the Society for the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS), at Uppsala University in Sweden, will bring together researchers working on the history of post-World War II social science. It will provide a forum for the latest research on the cross-disciplinary history of the post-war social sciences, including but not limited to anthropology, economics, psychology, political science, and sociology as well as related fields like area studies, communication studies, history, international relations, law, and linguistics. The conference aims to build upon the recent emergence of work and conversation on cross-disciplinary themes in the postwar history of the social sciences.
