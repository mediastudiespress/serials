## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

1. *Call for Papers and Panels ‘The Making of the Humanities X’, Pittsburgh* 
	* We are delighted to announce that Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) together with the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) will organize the 10th Making of the Humanities conference, from 3 till 5 November 2022. The MoH conferences are organized by the Society for the History of the Humanities and bring together scholars and historians interested in the history of a wide variety of fields, including archaeology, art history, historiography, linguistics, literary studies, media studies, musicology, and philology, tracing these fields from their earliest developments to the modern day. We welcome panels and papers on any period or region. We are especially interested in work that transcends the history of specific humanities disciplines by comparing scholarly practices across disciplines and civilisations.
	* **Deadline:** 15 May 2022
	* [More details](http://www.historyofhumanities.org/2022/01/28/call-for-papers-and-panels-the-making-of-the-humanities-x-pittsburgh/)
1. *Call for Submissions: 2022 Dorothy Ross Prize* 
	* The Society for U.S. Intellectual History (S-USIH) is now accepting nominations for the 2022 Dorothy Ross Prize for best article in US intellectual history by an emerging scholar (defined as a current graduate student or a scholar within 5 years of receiving the PhD). The article must have appeared in an academic journal in the 2021 calendar year and may be submitted by the author, editor, or anyone else. The winner will receive $500. The prize will be announced in July 2022 and will be awarded at the S-USIH Annual Conference.
	* **Deadline:** 1 May 2022
	* [More details](https://s-usih.org/2022/02/call-for-submissions-2022-dorothy-ross-prize/)
1. *CFP: 50th Anniversary Tribute to Dallas Smythe in China* 
	* The aim of this special issue of the *Chinese Journal of Communication* (*CJC*) is to bring forth Dallas Smythe’s intellectual legacy so as to link critical inquiry of the unfolding contestations with social struggles of the 20th century. While critical scholars often evoke Smythe’s concept of audience commodity and his treatment of “work” when examining immaterial labour and the new modes of exploitation in digital capitalism, Smythe has much more to offer. His critique of the “dependency road” and his consistent support for national sovereignties to extend democratic participation in development and governance, exemplifies the kind of critical praxis aimed at contesting global power structures. After all, one should remember that Smythe blazed a path of challenging Cold War-enforced sinological orientalism and engaging China’s self-proclaimed socialist theories and practices of development.
	* **Deadline:** 31 August 2022
	* [More details](https://nordmedianetwork.org/latest/call-for-papers/revisiting-communication-technology-and-development-a-50th-anniversary-tribute-to-dallas-smythe-in-china/)
1. *CFP: International Society for Intellectual History* 
	* The conference addresses the knowledge-power entanglement in intellectual history, including at the level of historiography. In recent years, the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, the growth of global inequalities, and the emergence of global conspiracy theories have brought to the fore the political dimensions of knowledge by eliciting debates on issues such as post-truth, the crisis of expertise, and the control of data and information. Drawing inspiration from the pressing issues of today’s world, #ISIH2022 will use the lens of intellectual history to explore the mutual influence of ideas stemming from the political and cultural realms, ranging from philosophy to the sciences, the arts, and literature. We also invite material and social inquiries into the political and cultural conditions that inform knowledge construction at three different levels: its roots, its validation processes, and its implications. This type of approach, which investigates the politically-informed, ever-changing historical conditions of knowledge, is what we refer to as ‘political epistemology’.
	* **Deadline:** 30 April 2022
	* [More details](https://isih.history.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=6723)
1. *CFP: History of Science Society* 
	* The History of Science Society (HSS) will hold its 2022 annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Although the meeting format is being planned for in-person attendance, proposals for virtual presentations will also be considered. Our conference theme is Sustainability, Regeneration, and Resiliency. We invite submissions on any topic in the history of science, but we especially encourage proposals of organized sessions and roundtables that address aspects of the conference theme.
	* **Deadline:** 24 April 2022
