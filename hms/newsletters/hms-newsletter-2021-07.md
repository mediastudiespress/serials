## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

*If you have a call or announcement relevant to the history of media studies, please [contact us](mailto:hms@mediastudies.press).*

1. *ICA Conference Theme Call for Papers: One World, One Network‽* 
	* The theme invites research, reflection, and critique of the “One World, One Network‽” discourse in communication studies. Arguably nothing celebrates the “one-ness” of the world more than our existential commitment to the sustainability of our planet. Indeed, the blue marble photograph of Earth taken by the crew of Apollo 17 in 1972 is one of the most reproduced images in history. In other areas, “One World” remains a contested slogan. Marshall McLuhan invoked visions of a “global village” in the 1960s. A 1980 UNESCO report titled “Many Voices, One World” introduced the phrase “New World Information and Communication Order” to recommend changes to address inequities in global media representations. The proliferation of the Internet, social media, and mobile technologies since the turn of the 21st century has generated a robust debate on the promises and perils of globalization.
	* **Deadline:** 1 November 2021

1. *Working Group on New Histories of Psychology* 
	* This Consortium working group builds on a virtual community, founded in the midst of the pandemic to connect scholars working in the history of psychology. “New Histories of Psychology” seeks to integrate the subfield of history of psychology into the heart of the history of science by reading cutting-edge scholarship that highlights major themes in the history of science—from the role of experts to the popularization of science. Our monthly themes focus on the intersections of psychology with contemporary issues, showing how psychology has been bound up in politics, publics, and power throughout its history. The content of monthly meetings will vary session to session, including a mix of key texts, panel presentations on a common theme, and workshop opportunities for works-in-progress. We welcome scholars at all career stages and all disciplines, including those in related fields concerned with the history, sociology and ethnography of the human sciences, as well as psychologists interested in understanding the history of their discipline. We aim to create a multi-disciplinary space for pursuing theoretically-informed, critical histories of psychology, involving scholars from different institutions, disciplines, and career stages.

1. *Working Group on History of Anthropology* 
	* This year’s series of readings focuses on anthropology’s many connections to race, racism, anti-racism, the anthropology of policing, white supremacy, and authoritarianism. They were chosen as a response to the Black Lives Matter protests and a strong wish to interrogate the field’s past, present, and future. We have sought to combine very contemporary ethnography with more historically-oriented work. The history of anthropology has become a lively object (and target) for reflection on how to confront centuries of imperial violence and racism-- legacies clearly still alive with the open return of white supremacy with the Trump presidency and other resurgent ethno-nationalisms, but also, as many critiques have made clear, built into the fabric of Western societies.
