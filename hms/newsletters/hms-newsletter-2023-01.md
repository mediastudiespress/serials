1. *CFP: Eighth Annual Conference on the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS)* 
	* This two-day conference of the Society for the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS), at Uppsala University in Sweden, will bring together researchers working on the history of post-World War II social science. It will provide a forum for the latest research on the cross-disciplinary history of the post-war social sciences, including but not limited to anthropology, economics, psychology, political science, and sociology as well as related fields like area studies, communication studies, history, international relations, law, and linguistics. The conference aims to build upon the recent emergence of work and conversation on cross-disciplinary themes in the postwar history of the social sciences.
	* **Deadline:** 10 February 2023
	* [More details](https://hisress.org/cfp/)
1. *CFP: Society for U.S. Intellectual Hitory* 
	* The 2023 Society for U.S. Intellectual History annual conference will be held in Denver, Colorado, November 9-11, 2023. The site for the conference is the Curtis Hotel right in the heart of downtown. The conference theme is “Utopia/Dystopia: Intellectual Landscapes of Dreams and Disasters.” We invite submissions that respond to the conference theme or that deal with any other aspect of U.S. intellectual history or the teaching of U.S. intellectual history.
	* **Deadline:** 15 April, 2023
	* [More details](https://s-usih.org/2022/11/2023-s-usih-call-for-proposals/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=2023-s-usih-call-for-proposals)
1. *CFP: The 24th International Conference on the History of Concepts.* 
	* The 24rd International Conference on the History of Concepts brings together scholars from all disciplines interested in conceptual history. It offers a platform for interdisciplinary exchange on the problems and practice of the history of concepts and fosters the international network of conceptual historians. Although the conference gathers a broad community of conceptual historians regardless of their topic and region of interest, this year we would like to encourage reflecting on concepts in a localized and/or spatialized manner. The point of departure is for us the very locality where the conference takes place, Eastern Europe. However, its spatialized condition has a much broader, global, and perhaps universal reach, characterizing various tensions and differentials of the global space of conceptual transfers and their impact on historical processes. 
	* **Deadline:** 30 March 2023
