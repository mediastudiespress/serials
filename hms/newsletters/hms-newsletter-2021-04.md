## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

1. *Registration Open: ICA Pre-conference on the Exclusions in the History and Historiography of Communication Studies* 
	* The broader field of communication studies is in a moment when we are--or should be--intensively interrogating patterns of exclusion and hegemony that have continued to constitute it: around global region (de-Westernizing, theory from the South, persistent patterns of Americanization), race (#communicationsowhite), gender (Matilda effects), and indigeneity/colonization (postcolonial and decolonial initiatives). It is time to animate our histories of communication and media studies with similar problematics, recognizing the patterns and performances through which the field(s) has organized itself around constitutive exclusions and continues actively to do so in epistemological and social practices of historiography. See the tentative [preconference schedule](https://hms.mediastudies.press/pub/schedule/release/4). [Registration](https://www.icahdq.org/event/PC-History) ($40/students free) will help cover the costs of simultaneous English-Spanish translation.

1. *CFP: MATRIZes*
	* *MATRIZes* is the scientific journal of the Graduate Program in Communication Sciences at the University of São Paulo. Launched in the second half of 2007, it is intended for the publication of studies whose object is communication in its multiple aspects and dimensions. It hosts theoretical and empirical research on communicational phenomena, means of communication and communicative mediations in social interactions. It is a publication open to reflections on technologies, cultures and media languages in their socio-political and cognitive implications. *MATRIZes* encourages the transdisciplinary horizon of communicational thinking and aims to resize knowledge and practices that contribute to define, map and explore the new contemporary communication scenarios. At the limit, *MATRIZes* seeks to be a privileged space for debates from different perspectives in the field of Communication. It aims to publish mature, innovative works that seek to expand the state of the art of the themes studied and, therefore, may have an impact on the field of knowledge. *MATRIZes* accepts submissions in Portuguese, French, Spanish and English.
