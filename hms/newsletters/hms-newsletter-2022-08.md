## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

*If you have a call or announcement relevant to the history of media studies, please [contact us](mailto:hms@mediastudies.press).*

1. *CFP: 50th Anniversary Tribute to Dallas Smythe in China* 
	* The aim of this special issue of the *Chinese Journal of Communication* (*CJC*) is to bring forth Dallas Smythe’s intellectual legacy so as to link critical inquiry of the unfolding contestations with social struggles of the 20th century. While critical scholars often evoke Smythe’s concept of audience commodity and his treatment of “work” when examining immaterial labour and the new modes of exploitation in digital capitalism, Smythe has much more to offer. His critique of the “dependency road” and his consistent support for national sovereignties to extend democratic participation in development and governance, exemplifies the kind of critical praxis aimed at contesting global power structures. After all, one should remember that Smythe blazed a path of challenging Cold War-enforced sinological orientalism and engaging China’s self-proclaimed socialist theories and practices of development.
	* **Deadline:** 31 August 2022

1. *2022 Osiris Call for Proposals* 
	* The Editorial Board of Osiris solicits proposals for Volume 41 which will appear in 2025 or 2026.. Osiris aims to connect the history of science with other areas of historical scholarship. Volumes of the journal are designed to explore how, where, and why science draws upon and contributes to society, culture, and politics. The journal’s editors and board members strongly encourage proposals that engage with and examine broad themes while aiming for diversity across time and space. The journal is also very interested in receiving proposals that assess the state of the history of science as a field, broadly construed, in both established and emerging areas of scholarship. Forthcoming volumes are concerned with medicine in/and translation; the history of algorithms and ‘algorithmic rationality’; disability and the history of science and animal mobilities
	* **Deadline:** 15 October 2022
	* [More details](https://hssonline.org/news/607307/2022-Osiris-Call-for-Proposals.htm)
1. *Call for Applications: Associate Editors, History of Anthropology Review (HAR)* 
	* The History of Anthropology Review (HAR) seeks applications from graduate students, early career scholars, or other interested parties to join its editorial team as Associate Editors. HAR has remained a critical venue for conversations and publications on the histories of the practice and impact of anthropology since 1973. We aim to continue this legacy by providing a platform for innovative and reflexive interdisciplinary dialogue on the discipline of anthropology, and the many ways of narrating its past, present, and future. We seek new members interested in expanding the boundaries of the history of anthropology and challenging normative interpretations of the field and its purview.
	* **Deadline:** 2 September 2022
