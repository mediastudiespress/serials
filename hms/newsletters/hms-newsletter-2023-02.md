1. *CFP: The 24th International Conference on the History of Concepts.* 
	* The 24rd International Conference on the History of Concepts brings together scholars from all disciplines interested in conceptual history. It offers a platform for interdisciplinary exchange on the problems and practice of the history of concepts and fosters the international network of conceptual historians. Although the conference gathers a broad community of conceptual historians regardless of their topic and region of interest, this year we would like to encourage reflecting on concepts in a localized and/or spatialized manner. The point of departure is for us the very locality where the conference takes place, Eastern Europe. However, its spatialized condition has a much broader, global, and perhaps universal reach, characterizing various tensions and differentials of the global space of conceptual transfers and their impact on historical processes. 
	* **Deadline:** 30 March 2023
	* [More details](https://networks.h-net.org/node/6873/discussions/11891695/cfp-24th-international-conference-history-concepts-agency)
