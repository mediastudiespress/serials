1. *Registration Open: ICA Pre on the Exclusions in the History and Historiography of Communication Studies* 
	* The broader field of communication studies is in a moment when we are--or should be--intensively interrogating patterns of exclusion and hegemony that have continued to constitute it: around global region (de-Westernizing, theory from the South, persistent patterns of Americanization), race (#communicationsowhite), gender (Matilda effects), and indigeneity/colonization (postcolonial and decolonial initiatives). It is time to animate our histories of communication and media studies with similar problematics, recognizing the patterns and performances through which the field(s) has organized itself around constitutive exclusions and continues actively to do so in epistemological and social practices of historiography. See the tentative [preconference schedule](https://hms.mediastudies.press/pub/schedule/release/4). [Registration](https://www.icahdq.org/event/PC-History) ($40/students free) will help cover the costs of simultaneous English-Spanish translation.
