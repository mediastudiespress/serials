1. *Workshop: Epistemic transfer* 
	* The workshop on Epistemic Transfer in the History of the Humanities is sponsored by the Society for the History of the Humanities. The purpose of this workshop is to grasp the phenomenon of knowledge transfer in a systematic way, in order to answer general questions such as: Why and how do humanities disciplines borrow knowledge from one another? Under what conditions has knowledge transfer been (un)successful in the past? And what light, if at all, do historical examples shed on current forms of (inter)disciplinarity? The event will take place digitally on 14-15 November 2023 and will be free of charge. The program includes both senior and younger career scholars. Full program to be published soon.

1. *ICA Panel on Brenda Dervin, Communication, and Global Human Rights* 
	* For those who might be interested in presenting at the 2024 ICA Conference in Australia, June 20-24, we (Lois Foreman-Wernet, David Schaefer, and CarrieLynn Reinhard) are drafting a proposal for a Conference Theme panel to celebrate the work of Brenda Dervin. The theme this year is Communication and Global Human Rights, and it is intended to: 1) take stock of the contributions of communication scholarship to the study of human rights; 2) to foreground current research and practice; and 3) to outline promising directions for communication studies. We think that Dervin’s work would fit well under this umbrella given her concern for dialogue and ensuring the voices of the unheard, her work focused on the communication practices of government and organizations, and SMM’s ability to bridge divides (disciplinary, methodological, and otherwise).
	* **Deadline:** 15 October 2023

1. *De-Westernizing Global Media Studies: Bridging Disciplinary, National, and Regional Divides for a More Inclusive and Decolonized Future* 
	* The IAMCR Presidential PhD Research Webinar on "De-Westernizing Global Media Studies" aims to challenge the field's Western-centric bias and pave the way for a more inclusive future. Scheduled for 12 December 2023, the event will explore strategies to diversify perspectives and foster global collaboration. It will investigate how the historical dominance of Western perspectives and theories in shaping the discipline has led to a dearth of diversity and inclusion. Potential topics include the legacy of Western dominance in communication and media studies and its implications for diversity and representation. 
	* **Deadline:** 20 October 2023
	* [More details](https://ecrea.eu/page-18206/13257400)
1. *History of the Human Sciences, Early Career Prize, 2023-24* 
	* *History of the Human Sciences* – the international journal of peer-reviewed research, which provides the leading forum for work in the social sciences, humanities, human psychology and biology that reflexively examines its own historical origins and interdisciplinary influences – is delighted to announce details of its annual prize for early career scholars. The intention of the annual award is to recognise a researcher whose work best represents the journal’s aim to critically examine traditional assumptions and preoccupations about human beings, their societies and their histories in light of developments that cut across disciplinary boundaries. In the pursuit of these goals, *History of the Human Sciences* publishes traditional humanistic studies as well work in the social sciences, including the fields of sociology, psychology, political science, the history and philosophy of science, anthropology, classical studies, and literary theory. Scholars working in any of these fields are encouraged to apply.
	* **Deadline:** 26 January 2024
