1. *CFP: The Future of the Field: Past, Present, and Future of Communication Research in Ibero-America* 
	* *RAEIC*, Revista Española de la Asociación Española de Investigación de la Comunicación, invites proposals for articles for its upcoming issue on "The Future of the Field: Past, Present, and Future of Communication Research in Ibero-America," which will be published in October 2023. Studies on communication research in Ibero-America have traditionally been an inexhaustible source of evidence documenting the origin and evolution of the field, dominant scientific patterns, and the impact of Ibero. In recent decades, this line of research has been consolidating, largely thanks to the structured efforts, but also the voluntary efforts, of many researchers from different traditions and sensitivities. In this context, it is interesting to revisit the ferment of our field, critically analyze what has brought us here, and consider the expectations and practices with which to anticipate the future….

1. *Free Online Discussion: A Rosetta Stone for Erving Goffman* 
	* Join Yves Winkin, Wendy Leeds-Hurwitz, Peter Lunt, Greg Smith, and Filipa Subtil for a discussion of Erving Goffman’s 1953 dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community, recently published as an open access book with a new introduction by Winkin. This free Zoom session, sponsored by mediastudies.press, marks the dissertation’s publication with a discussion of the work’s significance by Winkin and other leading Goffman scholars. Canadian-born Erving Goffman (1922–1982) was the twentieth century’s most important sociologist writing in English. His 1953 dissertation, based on fieldwork on a remote Scottish island, presents in embryonic form the full spread of Goffman’s thought. Framed as a “report on a study of conversational interaction,” the dissertation lingers on the modest talk of island “crofters.” It is trademark Goffman: ambitious, unconventional in form, and brimmed with big-picture insight. The thesis is that social order is made and re-made in communication—the “interaction order” he re-visited in a famous and final talk before his 1982 death. The dissertation is, as Winkin writes in the new introduction, the “Rosetta stone for his entire work.” It was here, in 360 dense pages, that Goffman revealed, quietly, his peerless sensitivity to the invisible wireframes of everyday life.
	* 5 May 2023, 15:00 UTC - (11am EDT/4pm BST/5pm CET) - 45 minutes
	* [More details](https://www.mediastudies.press/goffman-discussion)
1. *The Legacies of Elihu Katz: An ICA Pre-Conference*

This free preconference features presenters who will explore, augment, critique, and extend Katz’s many contributions to communication scholarship. Other presenters will situate Katz’s legacies in pertinent historical contexts. Still others will consider Katz’s many other roles (teacher, institution-builder, broadcast pioneer).
