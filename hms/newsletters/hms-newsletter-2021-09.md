## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

1. *BSHS OEC Project Grants: Call for Applications* 
	* The British Society for the History of Science's Outreach and Engagement Committee offers grants of up to £300 to support engagement and outreach projects in the history of science, technology and medicine.  Project grants are intended to support initiatives that encourage engagement with the history of science, technology and medicine by non-academic audiences. For example, eligible projects might include supporting the costs of holding a public event, the creation of a small public display, or the translation of research into educational resources. We particularly encourage projects that use innovative formats and reach audiences that might be new to the history of science, technology and medicine.
	* **Deadline:** 8 October 2021
	* [More details](https://www.bshs.org.uk/grants/outreach-and-engagement-project-grants)
1. *CHSTM Research Fellowships Available* 
	* The Consortium for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine invites applications for research fellowships in the history of science, technology and medicine, broadly construed. These fellowships are open to scholars at all stages of their academic careers, and will support research travel to Consortium member institutions as research activities can resume. Research Fellows will be awarded a stipend of $750 for use of each collection, $425 if the collection is less than 100 miles from another collection for which a stipend has already been awarded. Candidates who live 100 or more miles from the collections they will use will receive some preference. Fellows typically receive between $950 and $3,000 depending on number and locations of collections used.
	* **Deadline:** 15 September 2021
	* [More details](https://www.chstm.org/fellowships/chstm-fellowships?qt-fellowships=1#qt-fellowships)
1. *CFP: Knowledge on the Move: Information Networks During and After the Holocaust* 
	* The movement, production, and circulation of knowledge, ideas, and information through networks of marginalized groups and across borders and boundaries have increasingly become the focus of historical research in recent decades. At the same time, scholars have worked to integrate the perspectives of Jews and other groups victimized by the Nazi regime within Holocaust Studies in order to highlight their diverse forms of agency. For instance, the study of resistance networks, subversive knowledge exchange, and transnational commemorative efforts has fostered an understanding of the Holocaust that is grounded in broader local, regional, national, transnational, and at times overlapping contexts. "Knowledge on the Move" aims to bring together scholars who are reconsidering the Holocaust and its aftermath through the lenses of Jewish and non-Jewish information networks, broadly conceived. In a two-day workshop, scholars will present and comment on individual pre-circulated papers. This workshop aims to prompt innovative research questions regarding the information production and knowledge circulation in Europe and beyond during and after the Nazi genocide.
	* **Deadline:** 15 September 2021
