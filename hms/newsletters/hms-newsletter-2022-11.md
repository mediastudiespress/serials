1. *CFP: ICA Preconference on the Legacies of Elihu Katz* 
	* Elihu Katz (1926–2021) was a peerless scholar, colleague, mentor, administrator, and friend to many in the field of communication. His passing has left the field with an absence that calls out for remembrance and for scholarly consideration. This one-day, all-plenary preconference will create a space for scholarly exchange on Katz’s life, works, and themes—a forum, in other words, for active, critical engagement with his legacy for the field. The preconference invites presenters to explore, critique, and extend Katz’s contributions to communication scholarship. Some will situate Katz’s legacies in pertinent historical contexts; others will use his work to imagine media futures; still others will consider Katz’s many roles (teacher, institution-builder, broadcast pioneer, mentor).
	* **Deadline:** 20 December 2022
	* [More details](https://buttondown.email/communicationhistory/archive/ica-2023-preconference-on-the-legacies-of-elihu/)
1. *Call for Papers: Special Issue of Human Communication Research* 
	* *Human Communication Research* (*HCR*) historically has been, and remains today, an important outlet for projects that develop, advance, and critique communication theory using social science methods (broadly defined). The purpose of this special issue is to highlight and celebrate that key part of *HCR*'s mission (i.e., innovative theory development) on its 50th birthday both by taking stock and looking forward. Authors are invited to submit proposals for papers that advance our theoretical understanding of communication. Rather than provide literature reviews, these proposals should focus on theory development that will offer a roadmap for scholars to enhance our understanding of communication in ways that are both cognizant of our changing communication landscapes and that are inclusive with regard to issues relevant to our global and diverse societies. 
	* **Deadline:** 15 November 2022
	* [More details](https://academic.oup.com/hcr/pages/cfp-50th-anniversary)
1. *CFP: Eighth Annual Conference on the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS)* 
	* This two-day conference of the Society for the History of Recent Social Science (HISRESS), at Uppsala University in Sweden, will bring together researchers working on the history of post-World War II social science. It will provide a forum for the latest research on the cross-disciplinary history of the post-war social sciences, including but not limited to anthropology, economics, psychology, political science, and sociology as well as related fields like area studies, communication studies, history, international relations, law, and linguistics. The conference aims to build upon the recent emergence of work and conversation on cross-disciplinary themes in the postwar history of the social sciences.
	* **Deadline:** 3 February 2023

1. *New Journal: *History of Social Science** 
	* [_History of Social Science_](https://hss.pennpress.org/home/) is a new journal published by the University of Pennsylvania Press on behalf of the [Society for the History of Recent Social Science](https://hisress.org/) (HISRESS). _History of Social Science_ offers an international forum for the examination of the transformations of the social sciences since the early twentieth century. The journal covers a variety of disciplines, from the core social sciences of economics, political science, and sociology, to disciplines with links to natural science, such as anthropology, geography, and psychology, and disciplines closer to the humanities, such as history and philosophy. Related fields, including area studies, business, communication studies, criminology, law, and linguistics, are also included under the journal’s editorial scope. The journal is now [accepting submissions](https://hss.scholasticahq.com/for-authors). More information can be found on the journal’s [website](https://hss.pennpress.org/), including [Author Guidelines](https://hss.pennpress.org/author-guidelines/) and the [Editorial Board](https://hss.pennpress.org/about/masthead/).

## 3. The Journal

[*History of Media Studies*](https://hms.mediastudies.press) has appointed  [Esperanza Herrero](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-2142) (Universidad de Murcia) as Associate Editor for Spanish Language Scholarship, in support of the journal’s commitment to publishing in Spanish and to challenging the hegemony of English in scholarly publishing.

*HMS* encourages [submissions](https://hms.mediastudies.press/author-guidelines) on the history of research, education, and reflective knowledge about media and communication—as expressed through academic institutions; through commercial, governmental, and non-governmental organizations; and through “alter-traditions” of thought and practice often excluded from the academic mainstream.
