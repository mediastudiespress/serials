1. *CFP: 50th Anniversary Tribute to Dallas Smythe in China* 
	* The aim of this special issue of the *Chinese Journal of Communication* (*CJC*) is to bring forth Dallas Smythe’s intellectual legacy so as to link critical inquiry of the unfolding contestations with social struggles of the 20th century. While critical scholars often evoke Smythe’s concept of audience commodity and his treatment of “work” when examining immaterial labour and the new modes of exploitation in digital capitalism, Smythe has much more to offer. His critique of the “dependency road” and his consistent support for national sovereignties to extend democratic participation in development and governance, exemplifies the kind of critical praxis aimed at contesting global power structures. After all, one should remember that Smythe blazed a path of challenging Cold War-enforced sinological orientalism and engaging China’s self-proclaimed socialist theories and practices of development.
	* **Deadline:** 31 August 2022
	* [More details](https://nordmedianetwork.org/latest/call-for-papers/revisiting-communication-technology-and-development-a-50th-anniversary-tribute-to-dallas-smythe-in-china/)
1. *CFP: Power and Knowledge from the 18th Century to Today* 
	* Dating back to the beginnings of Greek democracy and the Platonic conception of the philosopher king, the relations between power and knowledge have recently come back to the fore with the rise of populism or the sanitary crisis. With an interdisciplinary approach, the conference will welcome proposals dealing with the relations between knowledge and power from the 18th century to today: papers can address the history of political and/or economic ideas, intellectual, cultural and political history or political science and sociology. In-person presentations, in English or in French, will be encouraged but arrangements for remote delivery may be made. A selected number of papers may be published.
	* **Deadline:** 24 June 2022

1. **OACIP Funding Secured for Five Years:** *History of Media Studies* was one of three journals included in the second round of LYRASIS’s [Open Access Community Investment Program](https://www.lyrasis.org/content/Pages/oacip.aspx) (OACIP), designed to connect no-fee (“diamond”) journals with libraries and other funders. With a [recent investment](https://btaa.org/about/news-and-publications/news/2022/06/08/the-big-ten-academic-alliance-announces-support-for-the-lyrasis-open-access-community-investment-program) from the Big Ten Academic Alliance, *History of Media Studies* has met our pledge goal of $12,500 per year for five years. Among other things, the consistent funding will help support our commitment to challenging the hegemony of English in the historiography of media studies.
