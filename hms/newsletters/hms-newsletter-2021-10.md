1. *Fellowship Opportunity: William Y. and Nettie K. Adams Fund, School for Advanced Research* 
	* The School for Advanced Research (SAR) in Santa Fe, New Mexico is currently seeking applications for the William Y. and Nettie K. Adams Fund. This fellowship offers funding for short campus seminars or summer research projects focused on the history of anthropology and the theoretical implications of the culture concept. The Adams Fund selection process is guided by the School’s longstanding commitment to support research that advances knowledge about human culture, evolution, history, and creative expression. This year, in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the Indian Arts Fund collection which we hold on our campus, SAR would be particularly interested in proposals which critically reexamine the “salvage” anthropology era of the early 20th century.
	* **Deadline:** rolling

1. *CFP - Jacques Derrida & Cinema studies * 
	* Jacques Derrida’s legacy, based on his in-depth insight into the ambiguity of literary theory with an emphasis on the method of deconstruction, flourished in the 1980s and 1990s in the context of 20th-century visual arts and film studies. The purpose of this volume is to rediscover deconstructive theory via its application to the pluralistic universe of film forms that disseminate in manifold directions and create differences across the film medium. In so doing, they reveal the differential specificity of the medium, which serves as the point of departure of the projected volume. 
	* **Deadline:** 10 November 2021
