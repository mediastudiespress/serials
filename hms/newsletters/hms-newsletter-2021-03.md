## 2. Conferences, Calls & Announcements

*If you have a call or announcement relevant to the history of media studies, please [contact us](mailto:hms@mediastudies.press).*

1. *Registration Open: ICA Preconference on the Exclusions in the History and Historiography of Communication Studies* 
	* The broader field of communication studies is in a moment when we are—or should be—intensively interrogating patterns of exclusion and hegemony that have continued to constitute it: around global region (de-Westernizing, theory from the South, persistent patterns of Americanization), race (#communicationsowhite), gender (Matilda effects), and indigeneity/colonization (postcolonial and decolonial initiatives). It is time to animate our histories of communication and media studies with similar problematics, recognizing the patterns and performances through which the field(s) has organized itself around constitutive exclusions and continues actively to do so in epistemological and social practices of historiography. See the tentative [preconference schedule](https://hms.mediastudies.press/pub/schedule/release/4). [Registration](https://www.icahdq.org/event/PC-History) ($40/students free) will help cover the costs of simultaneous English-Spanish translation.
	* 26 & 27 May 2021 (remote)
	* [More details](https://www.icahdq.org/event/PC-History)
1. *CFP: What Would Ursula Franklin Say?* 
	* Ursula Franklin is an interdisciplinary icon: she was a pacifist, an environmental activist, a metallurgist trained in experimental physics, and a philosopher of technology. Her honour as the first woman to receive the designation of University Professor at the University of Toronto in 1984 speaks magnitudes of her influence, as well as the gendered barriers both she and her colleagues faced in the academy. She spent her academic life advocating for pacifism, gender equality, and public good values for technology, while also making great strides in the material sciences. For this call for papers, we invite contributors to view their topics of study through the lens of Franklin’s lectures. We also strongly encourage perspectives that challenge gendered, racialized, and other marginalized boundaries in their work.
	* **Deadline:** 1 April 2021
	* [More details](https://www.mcluhancentre.ca/cfp-what-would-ursula-franklin-say)
1. *4th International Workshop on the History of Speech Communication Research*
	* **Deadline:** The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in historical aspects of all areas of speech communication research. Contributions on any such topic will be welcome. What is worth examining, among other things, is the approach of researchers to their material. The special focus will be on the link in linguistic signs between the form (sound) and the meaning (sense) in speech communication research
	* [More details](https://hscr2021.ff.cuni.cz)
1. *Call for Abstracts -- ESHHS 2021 Online Conference* 
	* The European Society for the History of the Human Sciences (ESHHS) invites submissions to its online conference to be held from June 29 to July 2, 2021. The timeframe still has to be decided on, but we will choose timeframes that are suitable for Europeans, but also allow scholars from outside Europe to join the meeting. Oral presentations, sessions or workshops may deal with any aspect of the history of the human, behavioural and social sciences or with related historiographic and methodological issues.
	* **Deadline:** 1 April 2021
	* [More details](http://www.eshhs.eu/wordpress-3.3.1/wordpress/?p=1488)
1. *JHoK Call for Papers* 
	* The *Journal for the History of Knowledge* is an open access, peer-reviewed journal devoted to the history of knowledge in its broadest sense. This includes the study of science, but also of indigenous, artisanal, and other types of knowledge as well as the history of knowledge developed in the humanities and social sciences. Special attention is paid to interactions and processes of demarcation between science and other forms of knowledge. Contributions may deal with the history of concepts of knowledge, the study of knowledge making practices and institutions and sites of knowledge production, adjudication, and legitimation (including universities). Contributions which highlight the relevance of the history of knowledge to current policy concerns (for example, by historicizing and problematizing concepts such as the "knowledge society") are particularly welcome.

1. *CFP: 30 years of higher education in journalism and communication in Eastern Europe after 1989: From conquering the freedom of expression to embracing digital communication* 
	* Between 1989 and 1990, in Eastern Europe emerged the first signs of a new social and political reality in which print and audiovisual media played a fundamental role in achieving freedom of speech. The first years were dedicated to fervent construction. Thousands of newspapers and magazines, dozens of television and radio stations were founded, contributing to an effervescent context, in contrast to the censorship of the authoritarian regimes in Central and Eastern Europe. In tandem came the interest for studying the impact of media, as well as the increasing need to train future journalists, equipped to undertake their role in a climate free of ideological constraints, and marked by freedom of expression. The post-communist journalism schools chose as models the Western European and American journalism, understood as practice of democracy.
	* **Deadline:** 18 April 2021
